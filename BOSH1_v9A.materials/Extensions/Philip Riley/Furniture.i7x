Use authorial modesty.

A drawer is a kind of container. It is openable and lockable.

A desk is a kind of supporter. A drawer is a part of every desk.

	if a drawer (called Dr) is part of D:
		try opening Dr;
		
Instead of closing a desk (called D):
	if a drawer (called Dr) is part of D:
		try closing Dr;

Furniture ends here.
