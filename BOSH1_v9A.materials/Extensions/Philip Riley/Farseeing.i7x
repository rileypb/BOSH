Farseeing by Philip Riley begins here.

Include Far Away by Jon Ingold.

Viewability relates various things to various rooms. The verb to be viewable from implies the viewability relation. The verb to farsee means the reversed viewability relation.

Definition: something is farseeable if it is viewable from the location.

After deciding the scope of the player (this is the add farseeable to scope rule):
	repeat with X running through farseeable things:
		place X in scope;

Farseeing ends here.
