  >--> In 'Table of Frustrated Taking' (BOSH1_v9A.materials/Extensions/philip
    riley/can't take that.i7x, line 7), I'm reading the text 'booth window' (BOSH1_v9A.materials/Extensions/philip
    riley/bosh polish.i7x, line 317) in column 1 (target) of row 22, but I
    don't know what this means. This should usually be a value, like a number
    or a piece of text, or a blank entry marker '--', but in some circumstances
    it can also be an action (such as 'taking the box'), or a kind (such as 'a
    number') to show what sort of values will go into an otherwise blank row.
