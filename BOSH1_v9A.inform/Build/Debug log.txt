Problem PM_ParaEndsInColon issued from inform7/Chapter 13/Sentences.w, line 231

  >--> The text 'Every turn during the Boss Battle:' (BOSH1_v9A.materials/Extensions/philip
    riley/boss battle.i7x, line 110) seems to end a paragraph with a colon.
    (Rule declarations can end a sentence with a colon, so maybe there's
    accidentally a skipped line here?)
