Problem PM_TableUnknownEntry issued from inform7/Chapter 25/Tables.w, line 970

  >--> In 'Table of Frustrated Taking' (BOSH1_v9A.materials/Extensions/philip
    riley/can't take that.i7x, line 5), I'm reading the text 'the sky' (BOSH1_v9A.materials/Extensions/philip
    riley/bosh polish.i7x, line 64) in column 1 (target) of row 10, but I don't
    know what this means. This should usually be a value, like a number or a
    piece of text, or a blank entry marker '--', but in some circumstances it
    can also be an action (such as 'taking the box'), or a kind (such as 'a
    number') to show what sort of values will go into an otherwise blank row.
