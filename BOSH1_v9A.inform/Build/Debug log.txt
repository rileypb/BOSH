    Problem PM_SpatialContradiction issued from inform7/Chapter 34/Spatial Model.w, line 216

    In Volume 3 - Geography, Book 17.5 - The church basement in the extension
      Enigma Lake by Philip Riley:


      >--> You wrote 'The church altar is scenery in First Utilitarian Church of
        Enigma Lake' (BOSH1_v9A.materials/Extensions/philip riley/enigma lake.i7x, line 970),
        but also 'The altar is a scenery supporter in the church basement' (BOSH1_v9A.materials/Extensions/philip
        riley/enigma lake.i7x, line 1258): that seems to be saying that the same
        object (church altar) must be in two different places (First Utilitarian
        Church of Enigma Lake and church basement). This looks like a
        contradiction. This sometimes happens as a result of a sentence like
        'Every person carries a bag', when Inform doesn't know 'bag' as the name of
        any kind - so that it makes only a single thing called 'bag', and then the
        sentence looks as if it says everyone is carrying the same bag.
