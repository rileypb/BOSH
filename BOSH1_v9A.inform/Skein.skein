Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC
Open on a drab office with decor dating to the mid-eighties. The DHS assistant to the associate sub-director looks longingly at the office clock nearing five, then leans across the desk and impatiently states his demands:

"First name, last name, pronouns?"

(1) Ezra Gaunt (he/him), winner of the 2006 Baltimore County Edgar Allan Poe Trivia Competition;

(2) Petula Clark Goldberg (she/her), former award-winning dog groomer of the avant-garde school;

or (3) Larch Faraji (they/them), lead singer of the third wave neo-old-school punk band DC Trash.

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road. The intersection lies at the edge of the lake. Lake Street runs south into town, while Ridge Road heads off into the darkness east of here. A little park along the lake shore is to the west.

There is an abandoned pickup truck at the side of the road.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.
