Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC
Open on a drab office with decor dating to the mid-eighties. The DHS assistant to the associate sub-director looks longingly at the office clock nearing five, then leans across the desk and impatiently states his demands:

"First name, last name, pronouns?"

(1) Ezra Gaunt (he/him), winner of the 2006 Baltimore County Edgar Allan Poe Trivia Competition;

(2) Petula Clark Goldberg (she/her), former award-winning dog groomer of the avant-garde school;

or (3) Larch Faraji (they/them), lead singer of the third wave neo-old-school punk band DC Trash.

The Bureau of Strange Happenings
An Interactive Phenomenon by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230518 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Good timing! Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their softball team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets.

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Agent Faraji is in their office. They pause and survey the scene. It's not much -- four white walls, grey industrial carpet. Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their softball team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot.

To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

The pawn shop door closes.

Faraji can go northeast (to the south end of the strip mall parking lot) or outside (to the south end of the strip mall parking lot).

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Good timing! Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

The pawn shop door closes.

Faraji can go northeast (to the south end of the strip mall parking lot) or outside (to the south end of the strip mall parking lot).

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Good timing! Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."
