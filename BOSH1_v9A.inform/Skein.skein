Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC
Open on a drab office with decor dating to the mid-eighties. The DHS assistant to the associate sub-director looks longingly at the office clock nearing five, then leans across the desk and impatiently states his demands:

"First name, last name, pronouns?"

(1) Ezra Gaunt (he/him), winner of the 2006 Baltimore County Edgar Allan Poe Trivia Competition;

(2) Petula Clark Goldberg (she/her), former award-winning dog groomer of the avant-garde school;

or (3) Larch Faraji (they/them), lead singer of the third wave neo-old-school punk band DC Trash.

The Bureau of Strange Happenings
An Interactive Phenomenon by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 231211 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing somewhere else not too far away.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

Margaret unlocks the white metal door.

Wearing the astral lenses in fluorescent light is blinding. Faraji quickly removes the glasses.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing somewhere else not too far away.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange.

A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

        <result xml:space="preserve">Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."
