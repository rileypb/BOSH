Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC
Open on a drab office with decor dating to the mid-eighties. The DHS assistant to the associate sub-director looks longingly at the office clock nearing five, then leans across the desk and impatiently states his demands:

"First name, last name, pronouns, biographical trivia?"

(1) Ezra Gaunt (he/him), winner of the 2006 Baltimore County Edgar Allan Poe Trivia Competition;

(2) Petula Clark Goldberg (she/her), former award-winning dog groomer of the avant-garde school;

or (3) Larch Faraji (they/them), lead singer of the third wave neo-old-school punk band DC Trash.

The Bureau of Strange Happenings
An Interactive Phenomenon by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230503 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret Chao is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Good timing! Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled. Hey, what are you doing for lunch? Let me know when you get hungry!"

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their softball team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Faraji exits the store into the relative quiet of the nearby traffic.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot.. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

Agent Faraji is in the pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy santized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

Also here is the pawn shop owner.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret Chao is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm.

Also here is a beat-up cardboard box (in which is their computer).

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

The familiar directions (north, south, up, northeast, etc.) work there, as do two new directions "back" and "forth", and their combinations with our compass directions: forthnorth, backeast, etc. These can be abbreviated just as compass directions can: b, f, fn, be, and so on.

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions, all but featureless.

In the floor (if it can be called that, considering that it extends in six directions from here) floats a set of ethereal symbols: ┌ : └ : ┐⌂

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forth.
