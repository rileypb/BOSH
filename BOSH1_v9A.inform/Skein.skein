Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC
Open on a drab office with decor dating to the mid-eighties. The DHS assistant to the associate sub-director looks longingly at the office clock nearing five, then leans across the desk and impatiently states his demands:

"First name, last name, pronouns?"

(1) Ezra Gaunt (he/him), winner of the 2006 Baltimore County Edgar Allan Poe Trivia Competition;

(2) Petula Clark Goldberg (she/her), former award-winning dog groomer of the avant-garde school;

or (3) Larch Faraji (they/them), lead singer of the third wave neo-old-school punk band DC Trash.

The Bureau of Strange Happenings
An Interactive Phenomenon by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230605 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Faraji can ask about-the-phone-exchange.

She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their softball team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Chief Klimp says "What's with that ringing? Someone answer it!"

On the Chief's shelves are a juvenile sasquatch skull and a pair of astral lenses.

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forth.

Under that is a line of five strange symbols: ◊ ┘ ┐ ┌ └

A mystic compass dangles from an outcropping of the pillar.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Good timing! Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at Enigma Lake, not far from where you found the drive. Now it makes sense that Daniels -- the agent -- would head for some kind of landmark so we could find him, and indeed there is a prominent intersection of leylines in the middle of the lake. Before you say it, yes it's a problem, if that intersection had always been underwater. But Enigma Lake is an artificial reservoir. The town of Enigma Lake was flooded when the reservoir was created, and that's where the intersection is!" Doris concludes with a look of satisfaction.

"So..." Faraji says.

"So. I'm sending you back to 1954, right before the flooding of Enigma Lake, and you'll find whatever Daniels left for us to find. Maybe we can stage a rescue. Why 1954? I'd rather not risk a longer temporal jaunt before we know what we're dealing with."

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

On the Chief's shelves are a juvenile sasquatch skull and a pair of astral lenses.

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forth.

Under that is a line of five strange symbols: ◊ ┘ ┐ ┌ └

        <result xml:space="preserve">Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Good timing! Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji can ask who he is, ask where we are or ask how to get home.

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at Enigma Lake, not far from where you found the drive. Now it makes sense that Daniels -- the agent -- would head for some kind of landmark so we could find him, and indeed there is a prominent intersection of leylines in the middle of the lake. Before you say it, yes it's a problem, if that intersection had always been underwater. But Enigma Lake is an artificial reservoir. The town of Enigma Lake was flooded when the reservoir was created, and that's where the intersection is!" Doris concludes with a look of satisfaction.

"So..." Faraji says.

"So. I'm sending you back to 1954, right before the flooding of Enigma Lake, and you'll find whatever Daniels left for us to find. Maybe we can stage a rescue. Why 1954? I'd rather not risk a longer temporal jaunt before we know what we're dealing with."

This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

Agent Goldberg is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Margaret has helpfully assembled Goldberg's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Goldberg's office decor -- her degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a photo of her dog Pluto, and a print of Green Pheasant by Utagawa Hiroshige. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Goldberg mutters, "Where's my computer?"
