As an agent of the Bureau of Strange Happenings (BOSH), it is Agent Larch Faraji's job to investigate unexplained phenomena throughout the United States and its territories. Recently, however, business hasn't been good. Once a bustling office with a dozen Agents, the Bureau's been reduced to just three: Faraji, Moira Zin, and Chief Huffton Klimp. The Bureau's expansive and well-appointed office suite was taken over by the State Department Book Club, and now the agents are consigned to a tiny suite in a strip mall in the remote D.C. suburb of Swamp Park, Maryland.

The reason? The venomous Senator Savra, whose crusade against all things he considers unwholesome is the scourge of Washington. To him, BOSH is nothing more than the devil's megaphone, giving credence to Satan's lies by giving them a hearing. Now Savra is at it again, threatening to cut BOSH entirely from next year's Federal budget.

But for now, today is move-in day at the bureau.

We open on a decrepit strip mall just as an aging Hyundai pulls into the potholed parking lot. Agent Faraji steps out of the car. They survey the area and wrinkle their nose.

The Bureau of Strange Happenings
An Interactive Phenomenon by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230620 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

Agent Faraji is in Moira's office. 

On Moira's bookshelves is Native Tribes of Upstate New York.

Also here is Moira Zin.

A phone is ringing somewhere else not too far away.

Wearing the astral lenses in fluorescent light is blinding. Faraji quickly removes the glasses.

Faraji can tell Moira Zin about the hyperdimensional portal or tell Moira Zin to wait for the report.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

An Interactive Phenomenon by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 230616 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing somewhere else not too far away.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange.

Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

Margaret unlocks the white metal door.

Faraji can ask about the status of the computer or ask about the phone exchange.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Agent Faraji is in their office. They pause and survey the scene. It's not much -- four white walls, grey industrial carpet. Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their softball team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside Faraji's desk.

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Chief Klimp says "What's with that ringing? Someone answer it!"

On the Chief's shelves are a juvenile sasquatch skull and a pair of astral lenses.

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forth.

There is an ethereal pillar here. A message carved into the pillar says "Seek the origin. -Doris"

Under that is a line of five strange symbols: ◊ ┘ ┐ ┌ └

A mystic compass dangles from an outcropping of the pillar.

Also here is an Ethereal Pillar.

Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

An Interactive Phenomenon by Phil Riley

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing somewhere else not too far away.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange.

She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji extricates themself from talking with Margaret.

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east.

A phone is ringing to the south.

&gt;s
Agent Faraji is in their office. They pause and survey the scene. It's not much -- four white walls, grey industrial carpet. Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

&gt;open desk
Faraji tries to open the desk to answer the phone, but it seems to be locked. They sigh. "Margaret must have the key."

Faraji steps out of the office into the parking lot.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

&gt;n
Faraji trudges to the other end of the parking lot. It's much like where they left.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

&gt;e
Faraji is greeted by a blast of music as they enter the store.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

&gt;ask for screwdriver
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Faraji exits the store into the relative quiet of the nearby traffic.

&gt;sw
(first opening the pawn shop door)
"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

The pawn shop door closes.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

&gt;ask for a screwdriver
Faraji leans on the counter and asks, "Do you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow for a few minutes? I'm from the Bureau office next door."

The man shakes his head and says, "Sorry. I had one, but the guy who runs the laundromat borrowed it and didn't bring it back."

Faraji can ask about the laundromat owner.

&gt;ask about the owner
Faraji says, "How do you suppose I might get in touch with this man who runs the laundromat? I really could use a screwdriver."

"Well, that's a tricky one. Laundromat's been closed for almost two weeks now, since the owner just split for some reason he didn't bother to share. Not likely to get ahold of him. If you're not averse to a little trespassing, though, see if you come across a watch. Another thing he borrowed."

Once again -- "Cha-ching!" -- as Faraji leaves the store.

&gt;push truck bs
Agent Faraji is in the astral tunnel. It is featureless white, or what passes for white here. It bends "back" to "forthnorth."

&gt;push truck back
Agent Faraji is in the back basement. The basement ends here. There is a switch on the wall, currently off. A doorway leads north.

A strange glow emanates from behind some stacks of large crates.

A hyperspatial tunnel leads in the direction of "forth".

&gt;move crates
Those are too heavy to move unaided.

&gt;move crates with truck
You move the crates out of the way and uncover an old front-loading washing machine. There is a strange glow inside the drum.

&gt;x washing machine
It's a front-loading model. The inside of the drum is obscured by a shimmering curtain of light.

&gt;open it
Faraji opens the broken washing machine.

&gt;enter it
There is a flash of light and Faraji finds themself somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forth.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

"Ah, Larch," Doris exclaims, standing up to shake their hand. "I've been waiting for you to pay us a visit. Did you bring the thumb drive?"

Faraji can ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

&gt;how him the thumb drive
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

&gt;hand it over
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

&gt;ask who he is
Faraji asks "Who are you?"

He looks taken aback for a moment, then recovers his composure. "Ah yes, introductions. I'm Doris, chief of the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau."

Faraji can ask about his name, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

&gt;ask about his name
Faraji says, "Tell me about your name."

"None of your business", Doris replies.

Faraji can ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

&gt;where are we
Faraji looks around and asks, "Where are we? What is this place?"

Doris answers, "You're in the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau of Strange Happenings. But I guess that doesn't exactly clear things up for you. Practically, your office is a branch of ours, but since you have the official recognition of the US government -- for now -- you get the glory. Besides, due to the nature of our work, we prefer to remain underground, so to speak. How's Klimp, by the way? Ah, we had some good times. But you know what they say -- what happens in Pompeii, stays in Pompeii.

Faraji can ask how to get home, tell Doris Klimp is fine or show him the thumb drive.

&gt;klimp is fine
Faraji says, "He's just fine"

"Great! Be sure to say hi for me."

Faraji can ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

&gt;ask how to get home
Faraji asks, "Just how can I get home from here?"

"Go ask Maggie; she can help you."

Faraji can show him the thumb drive.

&gt;show him the thumb drive
Faraji answers, "Yes, I have it."

"Fantastic! Hand it here."

Faraji can hand over the thumb drive.

&gt;hand it over
Faraji gives the thumb drive to Doris.

"Great, great." He peruses the drive. "We lost one of our New York agents to a slingshot effect that threw him far back in time. We're always monitoring for artifacts that are out of place or anachronistic to lead us to lost agents.

He continues, "The scratch marks here say, 'They found me out and sent me back. 14th century. Enigma Lake. Savra is going to move on the Dragon.'"

Faraji can ask about Savra, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

&gt;ask about savra
"Senator Savra? What does he have to with anything?" Faraji asks.

Doris says, "Well you've noticed he's not very friendly to the Bureau? Let's leave it at that for now. We need to talk about the mission."

Faraji can ask about the mission, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

&gt;ask about the dragon
Faraji says, "Who is this 'Dragon'?"

Doris brings his finger to his lips. "Classified. Need to know only. But we should be talking about the mission instead."

Faraji can ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

&gt;time travel
Disbelievingly, Faraji asks, "Time travel? For real?"

"Yes, yes," Doris responds. "Don't get too worked up over it. It gets old fast. But now we need to talk about the mission."

Faraji can ask about the mission.

&gt;ask about the mission
"Fine," Faraji says. "What's the mission?"

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at Enigma Lake, not far from where you found the drive. Now it makes sense that Daniels -- the agent -- would head for some kind of landmark so we could find him, and indeed there is a prominent intersection of leylines in the middle of the lake. Before you say it, yes it's a problem, if that intersection had always been underwater. But Enigma Lake is an artificial reservoir. The town of Enigma Lake was flooded when the reservoir was created, and that's where the intersection is!" Doris concludes with a look of satisfaction.

"So..." Faraji says.

"So. I'm sending you back to 1954, right before the flooding of Enigma Lake, and you'll find whatever Daniels left for us to find. Maybe we can stage a rescue. Why 1954? I'd rather not risk a longer temporal jaunt before we know what we're dealing with."

Faraji can ask how will i find him.

&gt;how will i find him
"How am I going to find him? Didn't he leave that message in the fourteenth century?"

Doris looks exasperated. "Well I don't know -- Improvise, use the power of the leylines, look around for anything that looks like it might be a time portal. Something like that. Let's see if the DC office can impress me. Let me know when you're ready to go."

Faraji can tell Doris they're ready to go.

Squaring their shoulders, Faraji says, "Ready to go."

Doris grins. "Great! First, you'll need this." He hands you a small device. "In case you need to come back for any reason, press this button and you'll come back here. Do not abuse this for trivial matters! Time travel consumes valuable resources. Now go. Out of my office and to the forth you'll find the portal room. It's all ready to send you where you need to go."

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at Enigma Lake, not far from where you found the drive. Now it makes sense that Daniels -- the agent -- would head for some kind of landmark so we could find him, and indeed there is a prominent intersection of leylines in the middle of the lake. Before you say it, yes it's a problem, if that intersection had always been underwater. But Enigma Lake is an artificial reservoir. The town of Enigma Lake was flooded when the reservoir was created, and that's where the intersection is!" Doris concludes with a look of satisfaction.

"So..." Faraji says.

"So. I'm sending you back to 1954, right before the flooding of Enigma Lake, and you'll find whatever Daniels left for us to find. Maybe we can stage a rescue. Why 1954? I'd rather not risk a longer temporal jaunt before we know what we're dealing with."

Faraji gives the thumb drive to Doris.

"Great, great." He peruses the drive. "We lost one of our New York agents to a slingshot effect that threw him far back in time. We're always monitoring for artifacts that are out of place or anachronistic to lead us to lost agents.

He continues, "The scratch marks here say, 'They found me out and sent me back. 14th century. Enigma Lake. Savra is going to move on the Dragon.'"

Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange.

&gt;w
Faraji extricates themself from talking with Margaret.

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east.

A phone is ringing to the south.

&gt;s
Agent Faraji is in their office. They pause and survey the scene. It's not much -- four white walls, grey industrial carpet. Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their softball team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside Faraji's desk.

&gt;open desk
Faraji tries to open the desk to answer the phone, but it seems to be locked. They sigh. "Margaret must have the key."

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

Faraji trudges to the other end of the parking lot. It's much like where they left.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

&gt;e
Faraji is greeted by a blast of music as they enter the store.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

"Got one to buy, not one to borrow."

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

The pawn shop door closes.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

&gt;ask for a screwdriver
Faraji leans on the counter. "Hey, do you have a screwdriver? Can't find mine and I really need one."

The man shakes his head and says, "Sorry, miss. I had one, but the guy who runs the laundromat borrowed it and didn't bring it back."

Faraji can ask about the laundromat owner.

&gt;ask about the owner
Faraji nods. "Okay, then, how do I get in touch with this laundromat guy?"

"Well, that's a tricky one. Laundromat's been closed for almost two weeks now, since the owner just split for some reason he didn't bother to share. Not likely to get ahold of him. If you're not averse to a little trespassing, though, see if you come across a watch. Another thing he borrowed."

&gt;ne
(first opening the pawn shop door)
Once again -- "Cha-ching!" -- as Faraji leaves the store.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Klimp's Porsche takes up two spots.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

The pawn shop door closes.

&gt;w
Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm.

Also here is Faraji's computer.

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask about the phone exchange.

&gt;w
Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east.

A phone is ringing to the south, in Faraji's office.

&gt;w
Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Looks like the Chief has already moved in.

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Chief Klimp says "What's with that ringing? Someone answer it!"

On the Chief's shelves are a juvenile sasquatch skull and a pair of astral lenses.

A phone is ringing not too far away.

&gt;x lenses
To all appearances an ordinary pair of glasses, the astral lenses allegedly reveal the existence of extra-dimensional pathways.

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Faraji can ask to borrow the lenses.

&gt;ask to borrow pair
Faraji asks, "Would it be okay if I borrowed the astral lenses for a while?"

"Sure! Why don't you scout the locality for astral phenomena?"

They take the astral lenses.

A phone is ringing not too far away.

&gt;wear them
Faraji puts on the pair of astral lenses.

&gt;take boxes
Faraji picks up a couple of boxes and flattens them.

Margaret says, "Hey, what are you doing with those boxes, Agent Faraji? You don't have to worry about that -- I'll get them." She takes the flattened boxes from Faraji and hustles off.

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Margaret goes west.

Also here is Margaret.

A phone is ringing to the south, in Faraji's office.

Margaret goes south.

&gt;s
Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair, and a disconnected phone on the desk. In lieu of windows, there are a few things on the wall: their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake, and a photo of their softball team. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Also here is Margaret.

A phone is ringing inside Faraji's desk.

Margaret unlocks the white metal door.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask about the phone exchange.

&gt;w
(first opening the white metal door)
Agent Faraji is in the back lot. This is a small area of asphalt between the building and a chain link fence looking in on an industrial property. A door to east leads into the BOSH offices, and one to the north enters the laundromat. There is a blue dumpster here.

A strange sparkly white passage branches off in an impossible direction from here.

Faraji has discovered a hyperspatial tunnel! It leads in the hyperspatial direction of "back".
For help regarding hyperspace, enter HELP HYPERSPACE.

A phone is ringing to the east, in Faraji's office.

Margaret arrives from the east.

&gt;back
Agent Faraji is in the astral tunnel. It is featureless white, or what passes for white here. It bends "forth" to north.

Agent Faraji is in the laundromat back room. A desk sits in the corner covered with paperwork. A doorway leads east to the laundromat proper, while a steep set of stairs leads down.

A hyperspatial tunnel leads in the direction of "back".

A phone is ringing faintly nearby.

Wearing the astral lenses in fluorescent light is blinding. Faraji quickly removes the glasses.

&gt;d
Agent Faraji is in the laundromat basement. A few boxes of supplies sit here and there in the otherwise empty space. Stairs lead up, while a doorway leads south.

&gt;n
Faraji can't go that way.

&gt;s
Agent Faraji is in the back basement. The basement ends here. There is a switch on the wall, currently on. A doorway leads north.

A strange glow emanates from behind some stacks of large crates.

Faraji switches the light switch off.

It is now pitch dark in here!

&gt;move crates
Those are too heavy to move unaided.

&gt;move crates with truck
You move the crates out of the way and uncover an old front-loading washing machine. There is a strange glow inside the drum.

&gt;x washing machine
It's a front-loading model. The inside of the drum is obscured by a shimmering curtain of light.

&gt;open it
Faraji opens the broken washing machine.

&gt;enter it
There is a flash of light and Faraji finds themself somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forth.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Faraji can ask about-the-phone-exchange.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Wearing the astral lenses in fluorescent light is blinding. Faraji quickly removes the glasses.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their Hyundai is parked nearby.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

Wearing the astral lenses in fluorescent light is blinding. Faraji quickly removes the glasses.

Faraji can tell Moira Zin about the hyperdimensional portal or tell Moira Zin to wait for the report.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing somewhere else not too far away.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange.

Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

There is an ethereal pillar here. A message carved into the pillar says "Seek the origin. -Doris"

Under that is a line of five strange symbols: o p q d b

A mystic compass dangles from an outcropping of the pillar.

Also here is an Ethereal Pillar.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

        <result xml:space="preserve">"Fine," Faraji says. "What's the mission?"

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at Enigma Lake, not far from where you found the drive. Now it makes sense that Daniels -- the agent -- would head for some kind of landmark so we could find him, and indeed there is a prominent intersection of leylines in the middle of the lake. Before you say it, yes it's a problem, if that intersection had always been underwater. But Enigma Lake is an artificial reservoir. The town of Enigma Lake was flooded when the reservoir was created, and that's where the intersection is!" Doris concludes with a look of satisfaction.

"So..." Faraji says.

"So. I'm sending you back to 1954, right before the flooding of Enigma Lake, and you'll find whatever Daniels left for us to find. Maybe we can stage a rescue. Why 1954? I'd rather not risk a longer temporal jaunt before we know what we're dealing with."

Faraji can ask who he is, ask where we are or ask how will i find him.

Do not abuse this for trivial matters! Time travel consumes valuable resources. Now go. Out of my office and to the forth you'll find the portal room.

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

On the Chief's shelves are a juvenile sasquatch skull and a pair of astral lenses.

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

There is an ethereal pillar here. A message carved into the pillar says "Seek the origin. -Doris"

Under that is a line of five strange symbols: ◊ ┘ ┐ ┌ └

A mystic compass dangles from an outcropping of the pillar.

Also here is an Ethereal Pillar.

A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Good timing! Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji can ask who he is, ask where we are or ask how to get home.

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at Enigma Lake, not far from where you found the drive. Now it makes sense that Daniels -- the agent -- would head for some kind of landmark so we could find him, and indeed there is a prominent intersection of leylines in the middle of the lake. Before you say it, yes it's a problem, if that intersection had always been underwater. But Enigma Lake is an artificial reservoir. The town of Enigma Lake was flooded when the reservoir was created, and that's where the intersection is!" Doris concludes with a look of satisfaction.

"So..." Faraji says.

"So. I'm sending you back to 1954, right before the flooding of Enigma Lake, and you'll find whatever Daniels left for us to find. Maybe we can stage a rescue. Why 1954? I'd rather not risk a longer temporal jaunt before we know what we're dealing with."

A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. It's probably beautiful during the day, but tonight the deep shadows among the trees seem ominous. Faraji is watchful and tense as they explore the park.

The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east.

The seeming sound of sibilant speech carries on the breeze.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Good timing! Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing not too far away.

Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their softball team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside Faraji's desk.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets.

Agent Goldberg is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Goldberg and practically squeals. "Agent Goldberg! I'm sorry -- Petula! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Goldberg hands Margaret her old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Goldberg says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing somewhere else not too far away.

Agent Goldberg is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Her Hyundai is parked nearby.

Margaret has helpfully assembled Goldberg's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Goldberg's office decor -- her degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a photo of her dog Pluto, and a print of Green Pheasant by Utagawa Hiroshige. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. There's a disconnected landline on the desk. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Goldberg mutters, "Where's my computer?"

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as a front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

A phone is ringing somewhere else not too far away.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange.
