>x faraji
Agent Faraji is dressed smartly in a black suit, with neat hair and a serious expression. Inside, they are a punk rocker, a fact that they are not shy about.

[Don't talk about me like I'm not here.]

>help
Suddenly Agent Faraji is surrounded by a white vapor. When it clears, they find themself somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is in the Bureau of Special Help. It is bare save for a bookshelf and a button on the wall marked "Exit". Faraji can go east or north from here.

You can type EXAMINE BOOKSHELF to see what's on the shelf, or PUSH BUTTON to leave help. You can also type a direction (like EAST) to move around. Type LOOK to repeat the description of the room.

>x shelf
The shelf is full of books, each with a title that seems to promise help with some problem or other. Faraji may READ any of them to get some help.

On the Help Shelf are IF Basics, Commands Volume 1, Commands Volume 2, Commands Volume 3, Strategies of Adventuring, Grammar of IF and BOSH Game Book.

>read bosh
The game you are playing is "Bureau of Strange Happenings", or BOSH for short. It is a text adventure game, a type of game where you interact with a world made of text. In BOSH, you play the role of Agent Faraji, a detective investigating strange occurrences in the United States and its territories. As Agent Faraji, you will travel to different locations, talk to characters, and solve puzzles to uncover the truth behind these strange happenings.

Some notes specific to BOSH:

1. The HINTS command will give you a list of available hint topics. You can then type HINT followed by the topic you want a hint on. Note that the available hints will change depending on where you are in the game. The HINTS command will bold-face the topics that have new hints available.

2. You will automatically talk to characters when you enter a room with them. You can type ASK character ABOUT topic to ask a character about a particular topic. Note that not all characters will respond to all topics. The characters do tend to know about things in their immediate vicinity and within their areas of expertise.

3. There are also a lot of books in the game, many of which are readable.

>read commands 1
This book will help you learn the basic commands you can use to interact with the world of interactive fiction. Here are some of the most common commands you can use:

LOOK (or L): This command will repeat the description of the room you're in. It's useful if you've forgotten what's around you.

EXAMINE (or X): This command will give you a closer look at an object in the room. You can type EXAMINE followed by the name of the object you want to look at.

TAKE (or GET): This command will allow you to pick up an object in the room. You can type TAKE followed by the name of the object you want to pick up.

DROP: This command will allow you to drop an object you're carrying. You can type DROP followed by the name of the object you want to drop.

INVENTORY (or I): This command will show you a list of the objects you're carrying. You can type INVENTORY to see what you're carrying.

GO (or MOVE): This command will allow you to move in a particular direction. You can type GO followed by the direction you want to move in. Alternatively, you can just type the direction (or an abbreviation) itself.

OPEN: This command will allow you to open a container. You can type OPEN followed by the name of the container you want to open.

CLOSE: This command will allow you to close a container. You can type CLOSE followed by the name of the container you want to close.

SAVE: You can type SAVE to save your game. You can then type RESTORE to restore your game to the point where you saved it.

One of the most important things to remember is that simple commands are usually the best. The parser is designed to understand simple, direct commands. If you're not sure what to do, try typing a simple command and see what happens. Good luck!

Agent Faraji is in the Observation Room. This small white room seems like a museum gallery, but with a window instead of art. Through the window you can see a lake at night, pelted by rain. Nothing can be seen through the storm-darkened waters.

A comfortable-looking viewing couch dominates the center of the observation room. Exits lead north and west.

You can type LOOK to repeat the description of the room. You can also EXAMINE an object to get a closer look at it. Or you can SIT ON THE COUCH. See what happens if you try to TAKE an object in the window.

Someone has left an umbrella on the couch.

>take lake
Faraji can't reach through the window.

>x lake
The lake is dark and stormy.

The view through the window changes.

Through the window one can see a creepy looking place. It looks like the parlor of an old house, maybe Colonial era. There is a table with some chairs, with a book on the table. On the periphery of window, something insect-like flutters, largely out of view.

Oh no, it's bad luck to open an umbrella indoors! Faraji should close it quickly!

The view through the window changes.

Through the window one can see a blinding white space with impossible geometry. What looks like a structure of some kind is visible in the distance, but it's hard to make out the details.

Sometimes things you need will be hidden. You can type EXAMINE FLOWERS to see if there's anything there.

>push button
Faraji presses the button and finds themself back in the real world.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

>x me
Agent Faraji is dressed smartly in a black suit, with neat hair and a serious expression. Inside, they are a punk rocker, a fact that they are not shy about.

>x shop
Faraji observes the pawn shop with obvious distaste. The flashing neon sign in the window advertises "Cash for gold!"

>x laundromat
Faraji peers through the windows of the laundromat at the rows of aging machines. A sign on the door says "Closed for renovations". They turn away, unimpressed.

>x car
(Faraji's Hyundai)
An old bright red Hyundai Accent, it's been their personal means of transportation for years. And since the Bureau lost its fleet, it's their work car too.

>x wash
Much like any other automatic car wash.

>x swamp
Swamp Park is, as one might expect, dotted with these little bits of wetland.

>x lot

>x office
Faraji gazes stoically at the sad little storefront that is the new BOSH office. The sign from the previous tenant is still up: "Angel's Department Store". Through the front window can be seen Margaret, in her usual manic work mode.

>x margaret
Even from here one can sense Margaret's irrepressible energy.

[Better get in there and slow her down before she explodes.]

>w
Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

>ask about phone
Faraji asks, "Tell me what's going on with the phones again?"

Margaret looks apologetic. "I'm sorry, I thought everyone knew. Budget cuts. They're trading in all our smart phones for cheaper models."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

>w
Faraji extricates themself from Margaret's clutches.

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. Faraji's door is open; Klimp's door and Moira's door are closed.

A phone is ringing to the south.

>s
Faraji enters their new office full of... is it anticipation or dread?

Agent Faraji is in their office. They pause and survey the scene. It's not much -- four white walls, grey industrial carpet. Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

>x desk
The desk is a cheap DIY piece held together with hex screws. It has a single drawer which is closed.

A phone is ringing inside Faraji's desk.

>open drawer
Faraji tries to open the desk to answer the phone, but it seems to be locked. They sigh. "Margaret must have the key."

"Sure I do -- I put it in your desk." She furrows her brow. "What's the matter?"

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

Margaret opens the BOSH back door.

Margaret goes west.

>w
The scent of asphalt and old cigarette butts greets Faraji as they leave the office.

Agent Faraji is in the back lot. This is a small area of asphalt between the building and a chain link fence looking in on an industrial property. A door to east leads into the BOSH offices, and one to the north enters the laundromat. There is a blue dumpster here.

Margaret is here, carrying a couple of flattened boxes.

A phone is ringing to the east, in their office.

Margaret tosses the flattened boxes over the edge of the dumpster.

Faraji can ask about the status of the computer, ask for the hex wrench, ask about the locked desk, ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

"Margaret", they say, "what's up with my computer?"

"Oh, it got busted up during the move. I have it behind my desk -- you can see it if you want. We'll have to get you a new one."

A phone is ringing to the west.

>x desk
The former sales counter now functions as a desk for the office manager (currently Margaret). Behind it are a number of shelves holding office supplies.

A phone is ringing to the west.

>x shelves
Pens, paper, nothing Faraji's really concerned with now.

Margaret grimaces. "I went over to look at the pawn shop, and the guy tried to hit on me. I told him I was married, but he didn't care. Do you think I'm bad for lying?"

A typical air register with a grill which one would hope would stop things like, say, a hex wrench from falling through. It's set in the floor behind the front desk. The vent is held closed by four screws.

Faraji's computer has been damaged beyond repair. But they do find a thumb drive and take it.

Faraji steps out of the office into the parking lot.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

(first opening the pawn shop door)
"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

[I've known public restrooms that had better ambience.]

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

Faraji gives the pawn shop owner a curt nod.
"Hey," Dave says.

The pawn shop door closes.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

They lean on the counter and ask, "Do you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow for a few minutes? I'm from the Bureau office next door."

The man shakes his head and says, "Sorry. I had one, but the guy who runs the laundromat borrowed it and didn't bring it back."

Faraji can ask about the laundromat owner.

>ask about owner
They say, "How do you suppose I might get in touch with this man who runs the laundromat? I really could use a screwdriver."

"Well, that's a tricky one. Laundromat's been closed for almost two weeks now, since the owner just split for some reason he didn't bother to share. Not likely to get ahold of him. If you're not averse to a little trespassing, though, see if you come across a watch. Another thing he borrowed."

The sound of a car door slamming outside catches Faraji's attention.

Faraji can ask about the watch.

>ask about watch

"It's a family heirloom. I'd like to get it back."

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

[It's like a museum of bad taste.]

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

Chief Klimp barks, "What's with that ringing? Someone answer it!"

He turns to Faraji and grins. "Larch! Good to see you. What do you think of the new digs? I know, I know, it's a lousy office, I could barely fit all my stuff in here."

Faraji starts to answer, but Klimp interrupts. "Say, you read that new article in the Journal of Kinetic Experimentation on telekinesis? It's fascinating stuff. But seriously, can you do something about that phone, or do I have to ship you off to the Black Knight Satellite?" He chuckles and goes back to his work.

Huffton Klimp, or simply "The Chief", who by his name and title should rightly be big and gruff, is a wiry guy with a thinning shock of red hair on top. Once the youngest and most devoted recruit in the Bureau, the years and his promotion to Bureau Head have not dulled his enthusiasm and idealism. He's a true believer in the existence of aliens, and he's convinced that the Bureau is the only thing standing between humanity and the alien menace. He's also convinced that the Bureau is the only thing standing between him and a comfortable retirement. He's a good guy, but he's a bit of a pain.

This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Klimp's Porsche takes up two spots.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Dictionary of Strangeness is a compendium of the weird and wonderful, from the Abominable Snowman to Zener Cards. Flipping through it, Faraji comes upon an entry:

Ghosts

Ghosts are the spirits of the dead that haunt the living. They are often said to be the souls of people who have died in violent or tragic circumstances, and are often said to be the spirits of people who have unfinished business on Earth. Ghosts are often said to be the cause of unexplained phenomena, such as cold spots, strange noises, and objects moving by themselves. The existence of ghosts is disputed by the scientific community, but has been proven by numerous eyewitness accounts and photographs.

Chief Klimp says "If you want to know more about anything in there, just ask me."

Klimp scratches his head and says, "You ever been to Istanbul? I met a guy there who said he was a time traveler. I didn't believe him, but he had a watch that was always right."

This desk is a beautiful assembly of smokey glass and chrome framing. The "legs" form shelves where Klimp keeps yet more curios. One might wonder where Klimp gets the money.

[Most of us just want a surface to keep our stuff off the floor.]

Klimp leans back in his chair and says, "How many people do you think have been abducted by aliens and don't even know it? I'd say at least half. Maybe more."

Suddenly Agent Faraji is surrounded by a white vapor. When it clears, they find themself somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is in the Bureau of Special Help. It is bare save for a bookshelf and a button on the wall marked "Exit". Faraji can go east or north from here.

You can type EXAMINE BOOKSHELF to see what's on the shelf, or PUSH BUTTON to leave help. You can also type a direction (like EAST) to move around. Type LOOK to repeat the description of the room.

>x shelf
The shelf is full of books, each with a title that seems to promise help with some problem or other. Faraji may READ any of them to get some help.

On the Help Shelf are BOSH Game Book, Grammar of IF, Commands Volume 3, Strategies of Adventuring, Commands Volume 2, Commands Volume 1 and IF Basics.

>read commands 3
This book will help you learn some more advanced commands you can use to interact with the world of interactive fiction. Here are some of the most common commands you can use:

PUSH: This command will allow you to push an object in the room. You can type PUSH followed by the name of the object you want to push. Sometimes you can push something to another room by typing PUSH object direction.

PULL: This command will allow you to pull an object in the room. You can type PULL followed by the name of the object you want to pull.

TURN: This command will allow you to turn an object in the room. You can type TURN followed by the name of the object you want to turn.

TYPE: This command will allow you to type on a keyboard or keypad in the room. You can enter TYPE something ON keyboard.

CLIMB: This command will allow you to climb an object in the room. You can type CLIMB followed by the name of the object you want to climb.

HIT: This command will allow you to hit an object in the room. You can type HIT followed by the name of the object you want to hit. Sometimes you can use HIT something WITH object. Not all games allow hitting.

AGAIN (or G): This command will allow you to repeat your last command. You can type AGAIN to repeat your last command.

>push button
Faraji presses the button and finds themself back in the real world.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

Klimp taps his foot and says, "You ever eat too much pizza and then have a dream about being chased by a giant pizza? I have. It's not fun."

The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

Hyperspace is a four-dimensional plane of being overlaying our own three-dimensional plane.

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

[This is the most featureless hyperplane I've ever seen.]

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forth.

Wearing the astral lenses is overwhelming here, so Faraji takes them off.

>d
Faraji leaves the descending stair behind.

Faraji descends the stairs and discovers... an office?

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

[I bet they don't get much foot traffic here.]

A young woman is sitting at the desk. Apparently doing nothing, she looks up from her desk and smiles at Faraji. "Hello, I'm Maggie," she says. "Welcome to the BOSH Hyperspace Field Office, Agent Faraji. Did you have a nice time getting here? I hope so. I helped design the lobby." She resumes staring at the opposite wall.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask about screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow?"

"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have a screwdriver. Do you?"

>x her
Maggie seems a little vacant. She's staring at the ceiling.

>>>>ask about office
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

>x directory
The directory reads:
 Doris, Field Office Chief: WEST
 Christy, Field Office Researcher: WEST
 Minerva, Field Agent: WEST
 Portal to the Past: WEST
 Auxiliary Portal: WEST
 Maggie, Receptionist: RIGHT BEHIND YOU

>w
Faraji leaves Maggie's relentless stare behind.

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north, south, east, west, forth, and back.

>w
Faraji enters the domain of the chief of the field office.

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

"Ah, Larch," Doris exclaims, standing up to shake their hand. "I've been waiting for you to pay us a visit. Did you bring the thumb drive?"

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>save
Ok.

>x doris
Doris sports a grin that seems to be permanently etched on his face. He wears a tweed suit and a trilby hat.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>x hat
The grin and the hat make him look like a cartoon character.

[He's like some strange caricature of Frank Sinatra.]

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>x suit
The suit is a little too big for him, but he wears it with style.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>>>>ask who
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>ask about who
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Doris looks at Faraji brightly. "You ever need anything, ask Maggie. She's the best. She's the only one who knows what she's doing around here."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask who he is
They ask "Who are you?"

He looks taken aback for a moment, then recovers his composure. "Ah yes, introductions. I'm Doris, chief of the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask about his name, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask where we are
Faraji looks around and asks, "Where are we? What is this place?"

Doris answers, "You're in the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau of Strange Happenings. But I guess that doesn't exactly clear things up for you. Practically, your office is a branch of ours, but since you have the official recognition of the US government -- for now -- you get the glory. Besides, due to the nature of our work, we prefer to remain underground, so to speak. How's Klimp, by the way? Ah, we had some good times. But you know what they say -- what happens in Pompeii, stays in Pompeii.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask about his name, ask how to get home, tell Doris Klimp is fine or show him the thumb drive.

>>>>*missing closing quotation mark
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

Faraji says, "Tell me about your name."

"None of your business," Doris replies.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask how to get home, tell Doris Klimp is fine or show him the thumb drive.

>ask about screwdriver
They ask, "Do you have a screwdriver?"

"No, I don't have a screwdriver. Sonic or otherwise."

Faraji can ask how to get home, tell Doris Klimp is fine or show him the thumb drive.

>ask about home
They ask, "Just how can I get home from here?"

"Go ask Maggie; she can help you."

Faraji can tell Doris Klimp is fine or show him the thumb drive.

>tell about klimp
There's nothing like that nearby.

>tell doris klimp is fine
They say, "He's just fine."

"Great! Be sure to say hi for me."

Faraji can show him the thumb drive.

>show drive
(to Doris)
They answer, "Yes, I have it."

"Fantastic! Hand it here."

Faraji can hand over the thumb drive.

>give drive to doris
They give the thumb drive to Doris.

"Great, great." He peruses the drive. "We lost one of our New York agents -- a guy named Daniels -- to a slingshot effect that threw him far back in time. We're always monitoring for artifacts that are out of place or anachronistic to lead us to lost agents.

He continues, "The scratch marks here say, 'They found me out and sent me back. 14th century. Old Onandaga holy place. Savra is going to move on the Dragon.'"

Faraji can ask about Savra, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>>>>*typo: Onandaga should be Onondaga
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>ask about savra
"Senator Savra? What does he have to with anything?" Faraji asks.

Doris says, "Tell me, Agent. Do you believe in aliens? That alien species have visited this planet?"

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation, tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation, ask about the mission, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>say no
"No. The Chief might, but I prefer hard evidence," says Faraji.

Doris nods. "Good, because they haven't. The whole idea is ridiculous. Senator Savra is not an alien." He looks at Faraji significantly.

They look at him unbelievingly. "What are you talking about?"

Doris shakes his head. "I thought you would know. He's a member of a race of Earth beings more ancient than our own. Agent Faraji, Senator Savra is a lizard man."

Faraji can ask what is a lizard man, ask about the mission, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>ask about dragon
They say, "Who is this 'Dragon'?"

Doris brings his finger to his lips. "Classified. Need to know only. But we should be talking about the mission instead."

Faraji can ask what is a lizard man, ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

>ask about lizard
They look incredulous. "And just what is a lizard man?"

"Just what it sounds like. It's a bipedal, intelligent reptilian creature."

Faraji can Savra's not reptilian, ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

>>>>*typo: Faraji can Savra's
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>ask about savra
"What about Senator Savra?"

"He's a pest, but he's a stupid pest, just like all lizard people. That's what you get for being cold-blooded."

>>>>Faraji can Savra's not reptilian, ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

>say savra's not
"But Savra isn't a reptile!"

"He's in disguise! Whatever, it doesn't matter. What matters is your mission."

Faraji can ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

>ask about time
Disbelievingly, Faraji asks, "Time travel? For real?"

"Yes, yes," Doris responds. "Don't get too worked up over it. It gets old fast. But now we need to talk about the mission."

Faraji can ask about the mission.

>ask about mission
They say, "What's the mission?"

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at an Onandaga holy place in the 14th century. Now we need to find out where that is. Fortunately, there's a book that can help. Unfortunately, I don't have it. Fortunately, you're here to go find it. Unfortunately, the name's gotten a bit jumbled in my head. I think it was something like New Bikers of Troy. Or something. I'm bad with things like titles and letters and keeping things the right way 'round. But you'll find it. I know you will. Come back here when you have."

>l
Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

The posters are all brightly colored and covered with strange symbols and diagrams. They're all in languages Faraji can't read.

Suddenly, Doris looks behind himself. "I guess no one is sneaking up on me after all."

>x maps
The maps are of places Faraji is pretty sure don't exist.

>x charts
The charts seem to be of some kind of scientific data, but Faraji can't make heads or tails of them.

>x desk
Doris's desk is large and made of the same white material as the rest of the office. It is covered with a chaotic mess of papers.

On Doris's desk are a model TARDIS, a Rubik's cube, a CMY cube and Doris's papers.

>x chair
It is a very nice swivel chair, worth more than Faraji's car.

>x papers
The papers are covered with scribbles and diagrams. But really, who can make sense of them?

Doris twiddles his thumbs. "Have you ever been to Budapest? I haven't either. I hear it's full of Hungarians."

>x tardis
It's a small, plastic model of a TARDIS.

>x cube
Which do you mean, the Rubik's cube or the CMY cube?

>rubik
It's a Rubik's cube.

Doris leans forward confidingly. "You know, I think there may be a mole in the Bureau. Do you know who it is? No, don't tell me. I'd rather not know."

How did Faraji get past a locked door last time?

>g
Faraji should knock on the door.

I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>knock on door
After a few seconds, someone inserts a key in the lock and opens the door. It's Faraji's colleague Moira Zin. "How'd you get in there, Larch?"

You exit the closet.

Agent Faraji is in Moira's office. It is, like Moira herself, neat and orderly. She's clearly made the most of the meager funds she had for furnishing her office. Behind a modest yet functional desk is a modest yet functional office chair. Her bookshelves are filled with titles relating to investigative techniques, law, and skepticism. In the east wall is a closet door. The exit is to the south.

Moira Zin is here, arranging her new office.

A phone is ringing to the south.

Wearing the astral lenses in fluorescent light is blinding. They quickly remove the glasses.

"Moira, do you have any money so I can buy a screwdriver, so I can get the hex wrench out of the vent, so I can open the drawer of my desk, so I can answer the phone?"

"No, I gave all my money to a vagrant this morning as I walked the 5 miles to work. I'm sure he needed it more than I did."

A phone is ringing to the south.

>x her
Agent Moira Zin is the very model of a competent Bureau agent. Hard-working, serious, no-nonsense but open-minded, she's the sober counter-balance to Klimp's sometimes childish credulity. Moira would clearly be a rising star if it weren't for the Bureau's pending dissolution.

There is a flash of light and Faraji finds themself somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is at the top of a descending stair. It is made of the same gossamer, questionably real stuff as the ground, the pillar, and the readouts. Faraji can't see past the first turn of the stairs, unfortunately.

On the readout of the mystic compass floats a set of ethereal symbols: o : o : o

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forthnorth.

>d
Faraji leaves the descending stair behind.

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

"Ah, Agent Faraji, you've found it! I knew you would. Now we can find out where Daniels is. Actually, Christy can help you with that. Go see her and give her this." He scribbles a note and hands it to you. "She'll know what to do."

He reads the note and grins. "I knew Christy could figure it out. Enigma Lake. Makes sense. There is a prominent intersection of leylines in the middle of the lake. Before you say it, yes it's a problem, or would be, if that intersection had always been underwater. But Enigma Lake is an artificial reservoir. The town of Enigma Lake was flooded when the reservoir was created, and that's where the intersection is!" Doris concludes with a look of satisfaction.

"So..." Faraji says.

"So. I'm sending you back to 1954, right before the flooding of Enigma Lake, and you'll find whatever Daniels left for us to find. Maybe we can stage a rescue. Why 1954? I'd rather not risk a longer temporal jaunt before we know what we're dealing with."

Faraji can ask how will I find him.

>ask how
"How am I going to find him? Didn't he leave that message in the fourteenth century?"

Doris looks exasperated. "Well I don't know -- improvise, use the power of the leylines, look around for anything that looks like it might be a time portal. Something like that. Let's see if the DC office can impress me. Let me know when you're ready to go."

Faraji can tell Doris they're ready to go.

>tell doris i'm ready
Squaring their shoulders, Faraji says, "Ready to go."

Doris grins. "Great! First, you'll need this." He hands Faraji a small device. "In case you need to come back for any reason, press this button and you'll come back here. Do not abuse this for trivial matters! Time travel consumes valuable resources. Now go. Out of my office and to the forth you'll find the portal room. It's all ready to send you where you need to go."

Agent Faraji is in Portal Room 1. The room is full of humming, glowing machinery, all of it attached to a large, arch-shaped portal in the middle of the room. The exit is back.

The portal, made of the same astral stuff this whole dimension is made of, looms over the rest of the room. Inside it is a shimmering curtain of light, leading to another time and place. On the right post is a control panel. A label on the top of the arch reads "Portal to the Past."

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding. A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

Faraji pushes through the back door into the cool night.

The drizzle picks up a bit, and the air grows colder.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. It's probably beautiful during the day, but tonight the deep shadows among the trees seem ominous. They are watchful and tense as they explore the park.

The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by stone walls.

>x obelisk

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "No one will be allowed to interfere with our plans. Begone!"

Faraji leaves the music store.

The storm rages, the air filled with the sound of thunder and the smell of ozone.

Agent Faraji is on the corner of Main and Solvay. Main Street runs east from here, while Solvay Road heads north. South of here, Henry's Hot Skillet promises all of the comforts of the mid-twentieth-century diner. A bookstore named The Reading Room lies to the west, while Fresnel's Music is southwest.

>smell
Faraji smells nothing unexpected.

>n
Faraji heads north along the west side of the town hall.

Agent Faraji is walking on Solvay Road 100 block. Solvay heads north and south. To the west is the fire station, while to the east is the side of the town hall.

>e
There is no entrance to the town hall from here.

To the north, some shadowy figures emerge from the park at the road leading out of town, moving west.

>n
Agent Faraji is walking on Solvay Road leading out of town. Solvay Road bends here, leading northwest out of town and south back into town. East is the park, and to the west is Horton House. One can walk down to the lake shore to the north.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "You are too late to stop us. We will have the Dragon!"

>ask about dragon
"Who is the Dragon?" asks Faraji.

"The Dragon, the greatest of all, corrupted by the surface vermin," hisses the lizard person.

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is in Radio Station WGXC. This is the town radio station. South is the entrance to the broadcast booth. A staircase runs upwards, presumably to the roof and the broadcast antenna. The exit is northwest.

>nw
Faraji exits the radio station onto Main and Lake.

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Main and Lake. Main goes west, while Lake runs north. The corner of the town hall is to the northwest, although it cannot be entered there. Southeast is the entrance to WGXC "Galaxy" Radio. There is a broadcast tower on top of the building.

>w
Agent Faraji is on 200 block of Main Street. The street runs east and west from here. South is the edifice of Rolle's Department Store. North is the town hall.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the west, on the corner of Main and Solvay.

To the west, the shadowy figures move out of view to the southwest, from Main and Solvay, into the music store.

>n
Faraji enters the town hall.

The mystic compass pings softly.

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding. A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

>x compass
The readout of the mystic compass says "62358234."

>read astral
Which do you mean, Astral Secrets or the pair of astral lenses?

>secrets
A book with a plain brown cover, titled "Astral Secrets". The author is listed as Jeremiah Horton.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.
