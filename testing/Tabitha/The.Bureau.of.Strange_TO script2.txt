>gonear church
Which do you mean, the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake, the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake, the church stairs, the church ladder, the church basement or the Church of Scientology?

>stairs
Agent Faraji is in the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake. The interior is dimly lit by the stained glass windows, and the pews are arranged in neat rows facing the pulpit. A standard electrical outlet is set into the wall. To the east is the vestry. You can also take a ladder up to the steeple, or stairs down to the basement. The exit is to the west.

>d
Agent Faraji is in the dark. Some light would be nice.

>wear lenses
Faraji puts on the pair of astral lenses.

Agent Faraji is in the church basement. The basement is a shock to behold after the simple church above. It's a large, open space, with walls painted with scenes of humans and lizard people in battle, with aliens and platypuses looking on in horror. There is an ornate altar at the far end of the room. The exit is up.

>x altar
On the altar is The Book of Utilitarianism.

>x book
(The Book of Utilitarianism)
Looking at the Book of Utilitarianism through the astral lenses is unbearable. The text is a jumble of letters and colors, and the words seem to twist and writhe on the page.

>take book
(The Book of Utilitarianism)
Faraji tries to take the book, but a painful shock stops them.

An extension cord lies on the floor, the table lamp plugged into one end and the other end plugged into the electrical outlet.

>u
The drizzle falls steadily, soaking the ground.

Agent Faraji is in the steeple. From here, they can see the obelisk in the park clearly. Someone has set up a tripod here. A telescope is mounted on it.

Stairs lead down to the church proper.

>x telescope
A small telescope suitable for amateur astronomy. It's mounted on a tripod.

The sad drizzle soaks Faraji.

>look through it
The telescope is pointed at the obelisk in the park. It's a bit out of focus, but Faraji can see it clearly enough.

>x obelisk
The obelisk in the park is clearly visible from here. 

>read astral
Which do you mean, Astral Secrets or the pair of astral lenses?

>secrets
A book with a plain brown cover, titled "Astral Secrets". The author is listed as Jeremiah Horton.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

To the northwest, some shadowy figures come into view from the west, at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road.

>x resonator
There's nothing like that nearby.

>gonear park
(the steeple-obelisk-facade)
Agent Faraji is in the steeple. From here, they can see the obelisk in the park clearly. Someone has set up a tripod here. A telescope is mounted on it.

Stairs lead down to the church proper.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the northwest, at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road.

To the northwest, the shadowy figures move out of view to the west.

>gonear hall
Which do you mean, the field office hallway, the Enigma Lake town hall, the town hall or the hallway?

>town
(the Enigma Lake town hall)
Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding. A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

Wearing the astral lenses in fluorescent light is blinding. They quickly remove the glasses.

>n
The rain falls steadily, soaking the ground.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by stone walls.

>x resonator
There's nothing like that nearby.

>x obelisk
Its faux Egyptian design is incongruous adjacent to the adamantly traditional town hall. Faraji can just make out a small crystal adornment rising from the top.

The cold rain pelts Faraji.

>x adornment
From what Faraji can make out, it's a clear crystal held aloft by some kind of metal fitting.

>n
Agent Faraji is on the lake shore north of the park. The continuous drizzle falls on the lake, creating ripples on the surface. The park is to the south, while the lake stretches off to the north. A workshed is to the southeast. A road can be seen to the east.

>se
Agent Faraji is in the workshed. It is a small, weathered building, with a single door and no windows, and a creaky wooden floor. The interior is dimly lit by a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling. A closed cabinet is in the corner. An open rusty metal door leads out of the shed. 

>take bulb
Faraji unscrews the light bulb from the socket.

>open cabinet
(first unlocking the equipment cabinet)
Faraji lacks a key that fits the equipment cabinet.

Agent Faraji is walking on Lake Street by the park. Lake Street runs north and south from here. To the west is the park, while to the east is the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake.

The extension cord you are carrying trails east into the church.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "So it is one of Doris's friends. We have been expecting you. You will not hinder us!"

>x object
You can't see much while the lizard person is holding it.

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is in the workshed. It is a small, weathered building, with a single door and no windows, and a creaky wooden floor. The interior is almost dark. An empty light socket hangs from the ceiling. A closed cabinet is in the corner. An open rusty metal door leads out of the shed. 

The extension cord you are carrying.

The mystic compass pings softly.

Agent Faraji is walking on Solvay Road by the lake. Solvay Road runs by the lake shore here. It continues out of town to the northwest, while to the southeast it leads back into town. A dirty shack stands opposite the lake to the west. A path along the shore leads to the east.

The drizzle stops, at least for now.

>w
Faraji enters the dirty shack.

Agent Faraji is in a dirty shack. Someone lives here, though not at all luxuriously. Plates are stacked up by the sink, and there's a pile of used paper coffee cups in the corner. The whole place stinks of cat.

A stripey orange cat sits in a corner of the room, grooming itself.

A bony old man lies on a bed in a corner of the shack. He stirs sleepily and says "Ah, there you are, there you are. Knew you'd be around eventually."

Also here is a sledgehammer.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask who he is.

>ask who he is
They ask, "You seem to know me, but who are you?"

"Name's Hutz. I'm the town groundskeeper. Or was, I guess. Not much to keep now."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask why he's still here.

>ask why he's here
They ask, "Why are you still here? The town is being flooded tomorrow."

"Had a feeling someone might come by looking for help. And here you are." Hutz grins, showing a few teeth. "I'm not going anywhere, not yet. Not until I've done what I need to do."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask how he can help them.

>ask for screwdriver

"No, not anymore. Got angry and threw mine in the lake one day."

Faraji can ask how he can help them.

[Kind of Crypt Keeper meets Groundskeeper Willie.]

Faraji can ask how he can help them.

Hutz says, "Something's running around out there. Something not human."

Faraji can ask how he can help them.

>*(re: cat)
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

"But how can you possibly help me?" they ask.

"You're looking for the secret of Enigma Lake, are you not? The secret about to be lost forever? Something calls you here; you're searching for something, no, someone. Yes, yes, Hutz can help you."

Faraji can ask about the secret of Enigma Lake or ask Hutz for help.

>ask about secret
"Secret? What secret?" they ask.

"Well, *I* don't know. Just kinda thought you must be searching for some kind of mystical secret, seeing that you're wandering like a fool through a town about to be flooded. But I can help you, yep."

Faraji can ask Hutz for help.

>ask about help
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Faraji can ask Hutz for help.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by stone walls.

>s
Faraji leaves the shadows of the park for the town hall.

The mystic compass pings softly.

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding. A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

>x compass
The readout of the mystic compass says "62358234."

Faraji exits the town hall into the cool of the evening.

The drizzle picks up a bit, and the air grows colder.

Agent Faraji is on 200 block of Main Street. The street runs east and west from here. South is the edifice of Rolle's Department Store. North is the town hall.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the west, on the corner of Main and Solvay.

>w
Agent Faraji is on the corner of Main and Solvay. Main Street runs east from here, while Solvay Road heads north. South of here, Henry's Hot Skillet promises all of the comforts of the mid-twentieth-century diner. A bookstore named The Reading Room lies to the west, while Fresnel's Music is southwest.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "So it is one of Doris's friends. We have been expecting you. You will not hinder us!"

>phenomenology
(to the group of lizard people)
At your word, the lizard people scream and hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. When the vapor clears, they are gone, but they have left something behind. There is a shiny astral resonator on the ground!


>x resonator
A small, shiny, metallic, cylindrical object. One end is capped with a lens, while the other terminates in two shiny metal chains, each with a shiny metal clamp, as if it were designed to be attached to something.

The storm rages, the wind howling and the rain falling in sheets.

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Fill it with the sound of the resonant instrument, bathe it in the ghostly light, and bind it to the astral focus. Strike the frame with my Rod to create the astral resonator. Ascend the ladder and channel a mighty power through the resonator, directing it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, illuminate the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

Agent Faraji is in the Second Floor of the Horton House. The second floor is a small, cramped space, with a single window looking out over the front yard. A small bed sits in one corner, while an open wardrobe fills a wall. A staircase leads down.

>d
Faraji heads back down the shaky stairs.

Agent Faraji is in Horton Family House Kitchen. The house is a modest colonial-period building. Strangely, the furnishings of the house have been left in place, despite the coming flood. An open hearth is in the center of the room, with a few chairs and a table. The parlor is to the south, and a narrow staircase leads up. To the east the front door leads out to Solvay Road, while another exit leads west to the family graveyard.

Faraji is carrying:
  The Witnessing of Hezekiah
  The Book of Weird Names
  a dowsing rod
  a shovel
  an old copper key
  a basketball
  a green key
  a large key
  a brass key
  a red key
  a mystic compass
  a pair of astral lenses (worn)
  a backpack (closed)

>open backpack
Faraji opens the backpack, revealing a strange piece of paper, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Tribes of New York, a recall button, a bell, Astral Secrets, a tuning fork, a sledgehammer and a shiny astral resonator.

>x resonator
A small, shiny, metallic, cylindrical object. One end is capped with a lens, while the other terminates in two shiny metal chains, each with a shiny metal clamp, as if it were designed to be attached to something.

>read witnessing
A small, leather-bound book, titled "The Witnessing of Hezekiah: as told to Jeremiah Horton by Hezekiah Horton". The book is filled with strange, cryptic passages, and is difficult to read. Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Fill it with the sound of the resonant instrument, bathe it in the ghostly light, and bind it to the astral focus. Strike the frame with my Rod to create the astral resonator. Ascend the ladder and channel a mighty power through the resonator, directing it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, illuminate the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

Agent Faraji is in Horton Family House Parlor. Faraji finds something creepy about this room, as if charged with the residue of strange events long past. Which is very peculiar, considering Faraji doesn't believe in ghosts. Perhaps it's the creepy doll-fly that flew out of here.

The parlor, like the kitchen, still has its furnishings in place. A few chairs and a table are arranged around the room.

The kitchen is to the north.

A hyperspatial tunnel leads in the direction of "forthsouth".

>fs
Faraji hesitantly steps into the astral tunnel.

Agent Faraji is in the astral tunnel. It is featureless white, or what passes for white here. It bends "backnorth" to "backeast".

>be
Faraji emerges from the astral tunnel into the fire station.

Agent Faraji is in Hook and Ladder Company #1. The fire station is a modest red brick building dating to the late 19th century. The garage door is to the east. There is a large blue button mounted on the wall.

A hyperspatial tunnel leads in the direction of "forthwest".

A ladder rests against the wall.

The doll-fly shrieks "Begone! Or I, Hobnop the Unimportant, shall smite thee!"

Agent Faraji is in the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake. The interior is dimly lit by the stained glass windows, and the pews are arranged in neat rows facing the pulpit. A standard electrical outlet is set into the wall. To the east is the vestry. You can also take a ladder up to the steeple, or stairs down to the basement. The exit is to the west.

Hobnop the Unimportant buzzes menacingly around the sanctuary, its eyes glowing with an eerie light.

The plug end of an extension cord lies on the floor, one end plugged into the electrical outlet. The other end trails west out of the church.
