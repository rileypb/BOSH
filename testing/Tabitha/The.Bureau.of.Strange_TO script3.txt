    -- Notes from Senate Investigation into BOSH, Senator S. Savra, Chair

[continue]


As an agent of the Bureau of Strange Happenings (BOSH), it is Agent Larch Faraji's job to investigate unexplained phenomena throughout the United States and its territories. Recently, however, business hasn't been good. Once a bustling office with a dozen Agents, the Bureau's been reduced to just three: Faraji, Moira Zin, and Chief Huffton Klimp. The Bureau's expansive and well-appointed office suite was taken over by the State Department Book Club, and now the agents are consigned to a tiny suite in a strip mall in the remote D.C. suburb of Swamp Park, Maryland. Today is move-in day at the bureau.

We open on a decrepit strip mall just as an aging Hyundai pulls into the potholed parking lot. Agent Faraji steps out of the car. They survey the area and wrinkle their nose.

The Bureau of Strange Happenings
An Interactive Phenomenon by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 240521 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Enter HELP for instructions.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

>cheat frame
Agent Faraji is in the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake. The interior is dimly lit by the stained glass windows, and the pews are arranged in neat rows facing the pulpit. A standard electrical outlet is set into the wall. To the east is the vestry. You can also take a ladder up to the steeple, or stairs down to the basement. The exit is to the west.

Faraji leaves the silent church behind.

Clear skies grace the town of Enigma Lake.

Agent Faraji is walking on Lake Street by the park. Lake Street runs north and south from here. To the west is the park, while to the east is the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "You are too late to stop us. We will have the Dragon!"

>phenomenology
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>say phenomenology
(to the group of lizard people)
The lizard people seem to find your words amusing. They hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is on the corner of Main and Solvay. Main Street runs east from here, while Solvay Road heads north. South of here, Henry's Hot Skillet promises all of the comforts of the mid-twentieth-century diner. A bookstore named The Reading Room lies to the west, while Fresnel's Music is southwest.

The sky clouds over, and the air grows cooler. The moon disappears behind a veil of clouds.

>gonear church stairs
Agent Faraji is in the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake. The interior is dimly lit by the stained glass windows, and the pews are arranged in neat rows facing the pulpit.

  a wooden frame (empty and open)
  a green smartphone

>e
Faraji steps into the vestry, hoping to find some vests.

Agent Faraji is in the vestry. It's a small room, with an exit leading to the church proper to the west. A lovely tapestry hangs on the wall.

The extension cord you are carrying trails west into the church.

>look behind tapesty
There's nothing like that nearby.

>look behind tapestry
Faraji pushes the tapestry aside, revealing a circuit breaker switch mounted on the wall.

>open box
There's nothing like that nearby.

>turn on breaker
Faraji switches the circuit breaker on.

The table lamp is now lit.

>out
Faraji leaves the vestry and reenters the sanctuary.

Agent Faraji is in the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake. The interior is dimly lit by the stained glass windows, and the pews are arranged in neat rows facing the pulpit. A standard electrical outlet is set into the wall. To the east is the vestry. You can also take a ladder up to the steeple, or stairs down to the basement. The exit is to the west.

The plug end of an extension cord lies on the floor, one end plugged into the electrical outlet. The other end is in their hand.

>put lamp in frame

>x lamp
An ordinary table lamp, with a red enameled base, a light bulb in the socket, but no shade. It looks like it's seen better days. On the base is the branding "Spectre". It is plugged into the socket end of the extension cord. The lamp is lit.

>d
Agent Faraji is in the church basement. The basement is a shock to behold after the simple church above. It's a large, open space, with walls painted with scenes of humans and lizard people in battle, with aliens and platypuses looking on in horror. There is an ornate altar at the far end of the room. The exit is up.

The extension cord you are carrying trails up into the church.

[I wonder if they have a Sunday school down here.]

>read book
The text is the Book of Utilitarianism. Faraji opens to a page at random and reads:

And the Lord so hated the lizard people that he smote them with a mighty smiting, and he said the cursÃ¨d word "epistemology", and the lizard people screamed and ran away like scared little children.

Faraji stands around and waits.

To the south, some shadowy figures come into view from the west, at the intersection of Main and Lake.

>s
Faraji heads south along Lake Street, towards the center of town.

Agent Faraji is walking on Lake Street by the gym. Lake Street runs north and south from here. To the east is the public gymnasium, while to the west is the town hall, which is not enterable from here.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the south, at the intersection of Main and Lake.

To the south, the shadowy figures move out of view to the west.

Clouds have gathered over the town.

>s
Faraji strolls south along Lake Street to where it meets Main.

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Main and Lake. Main goes west, while Lake runs north. The corner of the town hall is to the northwest, although it cannot be entered there. Southeast is the entrance to WGXC "Galaxy" Radio. There is a broadcast tower on top of the building.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the west, on the 200 block of Main Street.

To the west, the shadowy figures move west, on the corner of Main and Solvay.

Walking west on Main Street, Faraji approaches the entrance to the town hall.

Agent Faraji is on 200 block of Main Street. The street runs east and west from here. South is the edifice of Rolle's Department Store. North is the town hall.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the west, on the corner of Main and Solvay.

To the west, the shadowy figures move out of view to the southwest, from Main and Solvay, into the music store.

Faraji treads the eerily quiet street westward, encountering a clump of shops.

Agent Faraji is on the corner of Main and Solvay. Main Street runs east from here, while Solvay Road heads north. South of here, Henry's Hot Skillet promises all of the comforts of the mid-twentieth-century diner. A bookstore named The Reading Room lies to the west, while Fresnel's Music is southwest.

>sw
Needing a little culture, Faraji heads into the music store.

Agent Faraji is in Fresnel's Music. The music store, like most of the town, is empty of all but a few items of little value. The exit is to the northeast.

[It's like John Cage's 4'33" in store form.]

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "Silly human. You will fail!"

>epistemology

Faraji, hankering for a good book, heads into the bookstore.

Agent Faraji is in the Reading Room. The reading room is a small, cozy space, with a number of comfortable chairs and a few tables. A sales counter is at the back of the room. Bookshelves lead back into the depths of the store. A narrow staircase leads down and the front door is east.

[Look, I'd really love to sit down and read a book, but I've got a phone to answer.]

A book with a plain brown cover, titled "Astral Secrets". The author is listed as Jeremiah Horton.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

A small, leather-bound book, titled "The Witnessing of Hezekiah: as told to Jeremiah Horton by Hezekiah Horton". The book is filled with strange, cryptic passages, and is difficult to read. Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Fill it with the sound of the resonant instrument, bathe it in the ghostly light, and bind it to the astral focus. Strike the frame with my Rod to create the astral resonator. Ascend the ladder and channel a mighty power through the resonator, directing it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, illuminate the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

Agent Faraji is in the workshed. It is a small, weathered building, with a single door and no windows, and a creaky wooden floor. The interior is almost dark. An empty light socket hangs from the ceiling. A closed cabinet is in the corner. A closed rusty metal door leads out of the shed. 

>x floor
Faraji examines the floor closely, and discovers the faint outlines of a trapdoor. The vibrations cease.

>d
(first opening the trapdoor)
Agent Faraji is in a hidden cave. The cave is dark and damp, with a low ceiling. A passage leads to the south. A set of rickety stairs leads up to the workshed above.

[Perhaps there's something down here that will help me answer the phone.]

Faraji heads deeper into the cave.

>basement
Agent Faraji is in the laundromat basement. A few boxes of supplies sit here and there in the otherwise empty space. Stairs lead up, while a doorway leads south.

>u
Faraji climbs the narrow stairs back to the back room.

Agent Faraji is in the laundromat back room. A desk sits in the corner covered with papers. An opening leads east to the laundromat proper, while a steep set of stairs leads down. The back door is to the south.

>e
Faraji steps into the relative brightness of the front room.

Agent Faraji is in the laundromat. The deserted laundromat is lit by a flickering fluorescent light. The machines are old and worn, but still seemingly functional. An opening leads west to the back room.

Also here is a handtruck.

Faraji steps back into the shadow of the back room.

Agent Faraji is in the laundromat back room. A desk sits in the corner covered with papers. An opening leads east to the laundromat proper, while a steep set of stairs leads down. The back door is to the south.

>gonear parking
Which do you mean, the south end of the strip mall parking lot or the north end of the strip mall parking lot?

>south
Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Enter HELP for instructions.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

>n
Faraji trudges to the other end of the parking lot. It's much like where they left.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Faraji walks back to the south end of the parking lot.

>w
Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

>w
Faraji extricates themself from Margaret's clutches.

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. Faraji's door is open; Klimp's door and Moira's door are closed.

A phone is ringing to the south.

>s
Faraji enters their new office full of... is it anticipation or dread?

Agent Faraji is in their office. They pause and survey the scene. It's not much -- four white walls, grey industrial carpet. Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

[I've known public restrooms that had better ambience.]

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

Faraji gives the pawn shop owner a curt nod.
"Hey," Dave says.

The pawn shop door closes.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask about screwdriver
They lean on the counter and ask, "Do you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow for a few minutes? I'm from the Bureau office next door."

The man shakes his head and says, "Sorry. I had one, but the guy who runs the laundromat borrowed it and didn't bring it back."

Faraji can ask about the laundromat owner.

>ask about owner
They say, "How do you suppose I might get in touch with this man who runs the laundromat? I really could use a screwdriver."

"Well, that's a tricky one. Laundromat's been closed for almost two weeks now, since the owner just split for some reason he didn't bother to share. Not likely to get ahold of him. If you're not averse to a little trespassing, though, see if you come across a watch. Another thing he borrowed."

The sound of a car door slamming outside catches Faraji's attention.

Faraji can ask about the watch.

>ask about watch
They ask, "What's so special about this watch?"

"It's a family heirloom. I'd like to get it back."

Faraji takes a deep breath and enters the office of the Chief of BOSH.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Looks like the Chief has already moved in.

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

[It's like a museum of bad taste.]

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

Chief Klimp barks, "What's with that ringing? Someone answer it!"

He turns to Faraji and grins. "Larch! Good to see you. What do you think of the new digs? I know, I know, it's a lousy office, I could barely fit all my stuff in here."

Faraji starts to answer, but Klimp interrupts. "Say, you read that new article in the Journal of Kinetic Experimentation on telekinesis? It's fascinating stuff. But seriously, can you do something about that phone, or do I have to ship you off to the Black Knight Satellite?" He chuckles and goes back to his work.
