>church stairs
Agent Faraji is in the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake. The interior is dimly lit by the stained glass windows, and the pews are arranged in neat rows facing the pulpit. A standard electrical outlet is set into the wall. To the east is the vestry. You can also take a ladder up to the steeple, or stairs down to the basement. The exit is to the west.

An extension cord lies on the floor, the table lamp plugged into one end and the other end plugged into the electrical outlet.

Taken.

>u
Faraji climbs the ladder to the steeple.

The rain falls in a steady downpour.

WARNING: The current interlocutor is not nothing. It is Chief Klimp.

Agent Faraji is in the steeple. From here, they can see the obelisk in the park clearly. Someone has set up a tripod here. A telescope is mounted on it.

Stairs lead down to the church proper.

The extension cord you are carrying trails down into the church.

>x makeshift
The makeshift astral resonator is a cobbled-together device, made from a tuning fork, a spotlight, and the astral lenses. A short cord with a plug dangles from the end opposite the lenses, plugged into the extension cord. A beam of light shoots from the lens, striking a wall.

Faraji shivers in the cold rain.

>read witnessing
A small, leather-bound book, titled "The Witnessing of Hezekiah: as told to Jeremiah Horton by Hezekiah Horton". The book is filled with strange, cryptic passages, and is difficult to read. Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Fill it with the sound of the resonant instrument, bathe it in the ghostly light, and bind it to the astral focus. Strike the frame with my Rod to create the astral resonator. Ascend the ladder and channel a mighty power through the resonator, directing it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, illuminate the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

>point resonator at obelisk
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>put makeshift on telescope
Putting things on the telescope would achieve nothing.

The rain falls in a steady rhythm.

>x telescope
A small telescope suitable for amateur astronomy. It's mounted on a tripod.

>get it
Faraji takes the telescope from the tripod.

>put makeshift on tripod
Faraji manages to make the makeshift astral resonator fit in the tripod's mount. The beam of light focuses on the obelisk in the park, striking the crystal adornment at its apex. The crystal is glowing faintly.

>gonear diner
(Henry's Hot Skillet)
Agent Faraji is in Henry's Hot Skillet. This is the epitome of the homey small-town diner of times gone by, except for the lack of all furniture, cooking implements, food, decor, and so on. There is a staircase leading up, and the exit is north. A pair of insulated wires hangs from the ceiling at one end of the counter.

[It's a diner without any food or furniture. So, just a room, really.]

>u
Faraji heads up the stairs to the roof.

The rain falls in a steady downpour.

WARNING: The current interlocutor is not nothing. It is Chief Klimp.

Agent Faraji is on Henry's Roof. From here one can see much of the town, including a clear view of the obelisk in Enigma Park. There is a large TV aerial jutting from the roof here.

A bright beam of light shoots from the steeple, striking the obelisk in the park. The crystal is glowing faintly.

>x tv
A large, metallic rooftop antenna, characterized by its array of horizontal and vertical rods designed to capture VHF (very high frequency) broadcasts. Strangely, someone has mounted a threaded socket, like that of a light bulb, on one of the rods. A pair of insulated wires runs from the antenna and through a hole in the roof.

>gonear radio
Which do you mean, the broadcast tower, the WGXC "Galaxy" Radio, Radio Station WGXC or the radio station roof?

>tower
Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Main and Lake. Main goes west, while Lake runs north. The corner of the town hall is to the northwest, although it cannot be entered there. Southeast is the entrance to WGXC "Galaxy" Radio. There is a broadcast tower on top of the building.

A bright beam of light shoots from the steeple, striking the obelisk in the park. The crystal is glowing faintly.

>se
Faraji enters the radio station, which is oddly quiet.

WARNING: The current interlocutor is not nothing. It is Chief Klimp.

Agent Faraji is in Radio Station WGXC. This is the town radio station. South is the entrance to the broadcast booth. A staircase runs upwards, presumably to the roof and the broadcast antenna. The exit is northwest.

>u
Faraji climbs the stairs to the roof.

The storm rages, the wind howling and the rain falling in sheets.

WARNING: The current interlocutor is not nothing. It is Chief Klimp.

Agent Faraji is on the radio station roof. They can see the obelisk in the park clearly from here. The broadcast tower rises many feet above them. The exit is down. A metal cabinet is attached to the foot of the tower, held shut by a padlock.

>hint wires
I wonder what was connected to the wires before.

>g
Faraji might look on the roof for a clue.

>g
It looks like the wires run from the rooftop aerial. Too bad there's no TV to hook up.

>g
What could Faraji connect to the wires instead?

>g
Faraji should have a close look at the aerial.

>g
It looks like there's a strange socket attached to the aerial.

>pickup
Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road. The intersection lies at the edge of the lake. Lake Street runs south into town, while Ridge Road heads off into the darkness east of here. A little path along the lake shore is to the west.

There is an abandoned pickup truck at the side of the road.

A bright beam of light shoots from the steeple, striking the obelisk in the park. The crystal is glowing faintly.

Faraji opens the metal cabinet, revealing a power switch inside. It is set to off.

The moon occasionally peeks from behind the clouds.

>turn on switch
Faraji switches the power switch on. The broadcast tower begins to hum loudly.

>x tower
A tall, steel lattice structure, rising prominently above the building. This kind of tower was designed to maximize the height for better signal transmission and reception in the era before widespread cable and satellite technology. Strangely, the bars of the tower near roof-level are bent inward to form a small platform. It's almost as if something is meant to be mounted there.

>x platform
The platform is a small, square area formed by the inward-bent bars of the broadcast tower. It's just large enough to hold a small object. There are two rings set into the back of the platform, allowing something to be attached there.

>x rings
Two metal rings are set into the back of the platform, allowing something to be attached there.

>put shiny on platform

>gonear shack
(the dirty shack)
Agent Faraji is in a dirty shack. Someone lives here, though not at all luxuriously. Plates are stacked up by the sink, and there's a pile of used paper coffee cups in the corner. The whole place stinks of cat.

A stripey orange cat sits in a corner of the room, grooming itself.

A bony old man lies on a bed in a corner of the shack. He stirs sleepily and says "Ah, there you are, there you are. Knew you'd be around eventually."

Also here is a sledgehammer.

>get hammer
Taken.

>pet cat
The cat purrs and rubs against Faraji's leg.

>x man
The bony old man is more or less a skeleton in overalls.

[Kind of Crypt Keeper meets Groundskeeper Willie.]

>ask man about me
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask who he is.

>ask who he is
They ask, "You seem to know me, but who are you?"

"Name's Hutz. I'm the town groundskeeper. Or was, I guess. Not much to keep now."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask why he's still here.

>ask why
They ask, "Why are you still here? The town is being flooded tomorrow."

"Had a feeling someone might come by looking for help. And here you are." Hutz grins, showing a few teeth. "I'm not going anywhere, not yet. Not until I've done what I need to do."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask how he can help them.

>ask how
"But how can you possibly help me?" they ask.

"You're looking for the secret of Enigma Lake, are you not? The secret about to be lost forever? Something calls you here; you're searching for something, no, someone. Yes, yes, Hutz can help you."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask about the secret of Enigma Lake or ask Hutz for help.

>ask secret
"Secret? What secret?" they ask.

"Well, *I* don't know. Just kinda thought you must be searching for some kind of mystical secret, seeing that you're wandering like a fool through a town about to be flooded. But I can help you, yep."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask Hutz for help.

>ask help
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>ask screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow?"

"No, not anymore. Got angry and threw mine in the lake one day."

Faraji can ask Hutz for help.

>ask for help
They say, "Okay, how can you help?"

"Oh yes, how was I going to help? Afraid I can't remember, sorry. Can't seem to focus."

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

"Ah, Larch," Doris exclaims, standing up to shake their hand. "I've been waiting for you to pay us a visit. Did you bring the thumb drive?"

>give drive

>ask for help
"Now, you've had your coffee. Can you help me?" they ask.

Faraji puts the battery on the counter and attaches the wires to it.

All of a sudden the obelisk itself begins to glow. The light from the crystal at its apex grows brighter and brighter, until it's almost blinding. Shielding their eyes, Faraji watches as the space around the obelisk shimmers and distorts. The previously gentle breeze is now a gale, shivering the television aerial. Then, with a huge crack, a bolt of lightning strikes the crystal. One can almost sense the electricity penetrating the earth. searching for something. And then, it's found it. Below the obelisk, something has woken.

Faraji pushes through the back door into the cool night.

Clouds have gathered over the town.

WARNING: The current interlocutor is not nothing. It is Hutz.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. It's probably beautiful during the day, but tonight the deep shadows among the trees seem ominous. They are watchful and tense as they explore the park.

The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by stone walls.

>s
WARNING: The current interlocutor is not nothing. It is Hutz.

Agent Faraji is in the circular chamber. The chamber is circular, with a low ceiling. The walls are rough-hewn stone. A passage leads to the north.

A shimmering portal hovers in the center of the chamber, casting a faint light over the room.

>x portal
This portal seems to be natural, if that's indeed a possibility. It's a shimmering white oval, about six feet high and four feet wide. It's not clear where it leads.

[Another goldang portal. Could someone at least label where they go?]

>in
What does Faraji want to enter?

>save
Ok.

>enter portal
Faraji steps through the portal. The circular chamber vanishes, and they find themself somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is in an old root cellar. The chamber is dark and damp, smelling of earth and old vegetable matter. The walls, floor, and ceiling are packed earth. Around the walls are numerous woven baskets for storing vegetables. Light filters in from a passage to the north.

A tired-looking man sits on the floor of the cellar. He looks up as Faraji appears. "Ah, you must be the help I was promised," he says. "I'm Daniels. I've been waiting for you."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask how he got here or ask where we are.

>x baskets
The baskets are woven from reeds and are filled with root vegetables.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask how he got here or ask where we are.

He checks his pockets. "Sadly, no," he responds.

Faraji can ask how he got here or ask where we are.

>ask how
Faraji says, "How did you end up stranded here?"

"I was hunting down Savra's minions," Daniels says, "but they caught me and sent me way back to the past. I've been stuck here ever since."

Faraji can ask where we are or ask what's next.

>ask where
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>ask where we are
Faraji asks, "Where are we?"

"We're in an old Onandaga root cellar in upstate New York. Well not so old now, I guess. I've managed to make friends with the locals well enough, so they let me sleep in here."

Faraji can ask what's next.

"Doris must have given you a recall button. I can rejigger it to send me to the hyperspace office and send you back to Swamp Park. I own the laundromat, by the way. Sorry I wasn't there to greet you. Alright, give me the button."

Daniels" face falls. "What? You don't have the recall button? Do you know what that means? We have no way back!" He looks around the room, then back at Faraji. "We're stuck here."

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

Doris sports a grin that seems to be permanently etched on his face. He wears a tweed suit and a trilby hat.

Faraji can ask what's next.

He looks taken aback for a moment, then recovers his composure. "Ah yes, introductions. I'm Doris, chief of the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask about his name, ask where we are, ask how to get home, tell Doris they don't have it or show him the thumb drive.

Faraji can ask where we are, tell Doris they don't have it or show him the thumb drive.

>ask where we
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>ask where we are
Faraji looks around and asks, "Where are we? What is this place?"

Doris answers, "You're in the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau of Strange Happenings. But I guess that doesn't exactly clear things up for you. Practically, your office is a branch of ours, but since you have the official recognition of the US government -- for now -- you get the glory. Besides, due to the nature of our work, we prefer to remain underground, so to speak. How's Klimp, by the way? Ah, we had some good times. But you know what they say -- what happens in Pompeii, stays in Pompeii.

Faraji can tell Doris Klimp is fine, tell Doris they don't have it or show him the thumb drive.

>tell klimp
There's nothing like that nearby.

>tell doris klimp is fine
They say, "He's just fine."

"Great! Be sure to say hi for me."

Faraji can tell Doris they don't have it or show him the thumb drive.

>show drive
(to Doris)
They answer, "Yes, I have it."

"Fantastic! Hand it here."

Faraji can hand over the thumb drive.

>give drive
(to Doris)
They give the thumb drive to Doris.

"Great, great." He peruses the drive. "We lost one of our New York agents -- a guy named Daniels -- to a slingshot effect that threw him far back in time. We're always monitoring for artifacts that are out of place or anachronistic to lead us to lost agents.

He continues, "The scratch marks here say, 'They found me out and sent me back. 14th century. Old Onandaga holy place. Savra is going to move on the Dragon.'"

Faraji can ask about Savra, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>ask savra
"Senator Savra? What does he have to with anything?" Faraji asks.

Doris says, "Tell me, Agent. Do you believe in aliens? That alien species have visited this planet?"

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation, tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation, ask about the mission, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>ask dragon. ask travel
They say, "Who is this 'Dragon'?"

Doris brings his finger to his lips. "Classified. Need to know only. But we should be talking about the mission instead."

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation, tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation, ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

Disbelievingly, Faraji asks, "Time travel? For real?"

"Yes, yes," Doris responds. "Don't get too worked up over it. It gets old fast. But now we need to talk about the mission."

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation, tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation or ask about the mission.

>tell don't
There's nothing like that nearby.

>tell don't believe
There's nothing like that nearby.

>don't believe
"No. The Chief might, but I prefer hard evidence," says Faraji.

Doris nods. "Good, because they haven't. The whole idea is ridiculous. Senator Savra is not an alien." He looks at Faraji significantly.

They look at him unbelievingly. "What are you talking about?"

Doris shakes his head. "I thought you would know. He's a member of a race of Earth beings more ancient than our own. Agent Faraji, Senator Savra is a lizard man."

Faraji can ask what is a lizard man or ask about the mission.

>lizard
They look incredulous. "And just what is a lizard man?"

"Just what it sounds like. It's a bipedal, intelligent reptilian creature."

Faraji can Savra's not reptilian or ask about the mission.

>mission
They say, "What's the mission?"

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at an Onandaga holy place in the 14th century. Now we need to find out where that is. Fortunately, there's a book that can help. Unfortunately, I don't have it. Fortunately, you're here to go find it. Unfortunately, the name's gotten a bit jumbled in my head. I think it was something like New Bikers of Troy. Or something. I'm bad with things like titles and letters and keeping things the right way 'round. But you'll find it. I know you will. Come back here when you have."

Faraji can Savra's not reptilian.

"He's in disguise! Whatever, it doesn't matter. What matters is your mission."

Agent Faraji is in Moira's office. It is, like Moira herself, neat and orderly. She's clearly made the most of the meager funds she had for furnishing her office.

This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

As you enter the store, you catch a glimpse of a red screwdriver in the glass case under the counter.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center.
