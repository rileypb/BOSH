Suddenly Agent Faraji is surrounded by a white vapor. When it clears, they find themself somewhere else...

>? Is the help stuck on? Is there as way turn it off for those who know how IF works?
I didn't understand that sentence.

>? Sorry, ignore that! I hadn't read that line yet! :)
There's no one here to talk to.

I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>EXAMINE BOOKSHELF
The shelf is full of books, each with a title that seems to promise help with some problem or other. Faraji may READ any of them to get some help.

On the Help Shelf are IF Basics, Commands Volume 1, Commands Volume 2, Commands Volume 3, Strategies of Adventuring, Grammar of IF and BOSH Game Book.

Faraji lacks a key that fits the living room door.

Agent Faraji is in the Observation Room. This small white room seems like a museum gallery, but with a window instead of art. Through the window you can see a lake at night, pelted by rain. Nothing can be seen through the storm-darkened waters.

A comfortable-looking viewing couch dominates the center of the observation room. Exits lead north and west.

You can type LOOK to repeat the description of the room. You can also EXAMINE an object to get a closer look at it. Or you can SIT ON THE COUCH. See what happens if you try to TAKE an object in the window.

Someone has left an umbrella on the couch.

>x window
Through the window one can see a lake at night, pelted by rain. Nothing can be seen through the storm-darkened waters.

The view through the window changes.

Through the window one can see a creepy looking place. It looks like the parlor of an old house, maybe Colonial era. There is a table with some chairs, with a book on the table. On the periphery of window, something insect-like flutters, largely out of view.

Taken. Try taking INVENTORY to see what you picked up.

The view through the window changes.

Through the window one can see a steeple in a small town. The steeple is old and weathered, and the town looks deserted. There is a telescope on a tripod, pointed at the town.

Oh no, it's bad luck to open an umbrella indoors! Faraji should close it quickly!

>close it
Faraji closes the umbrella. Phew!

You can see the Bad Luck Counter in the status line (up at the top of the screen). When it reaches 0, Faraji will be safe from bad luck.

Oops! Faraji drops the umbrella.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

Faraji gazes stoically at the sad little storefront that is the new BOSH office. The sign from the previous tenant is still up: "Angel's Department Store". Through the front window can be seen Margaret, in her usual manic work mode.

Faraji observes the pawn shop with obvious distaste. The flashing neon sign in the window advertises "Cash for gold!"

It's just a piece of stationery marked up with Sharpie and taped to the door. It says "Closed for renovations".

>x car
(Faraji's Hyundai)
An old bright red Hyundai Accent, it's been their personal means of transportation for years. And since the Bureau lost its fleet, it's their work car too. Two years ago, they had to replace the hood after a window A/C unit fell on it. Now it doesn't exactly match the rest of the car.

>x automatic
Much like any other automatic car wash.

Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the west.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

Faraji steps out of the office into the parking lot.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

>s
The swamp would just muck up Agent Faraji's clothes.

>n
Faraji trudges to the other end of the parking lot. It's much like where they left.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Faraji is greeted by a blast of music as they enter the store.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

"Good morning," Faraji says.
"Yeah," replies the clerk.

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

[I've known public restrooms that had better ambience.]

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

"Hey," Dave says.

Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair. In lieu of windows, there are a few things on the wall: their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake, and a photo of their soccer team. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Faraji will think about joining the military once the Bureau shuts down.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm.

It's a red plastic thumb drive, with what look like symbols scratched on the surface, but they're like no symbols you've ever seen. The metal USB end is somewhat corroded.

In the heating vent is a hex wrench.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

As you enter the store, you catch a glimpse of a red screwdriver in the glass case under the counter.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

"Got one to buy, not one to borrow."

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair.

(first opening the pawn shop door)
Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

The pawn shop door closes.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask for a screwdriver
They lean on the counter and ask, "Do you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow for a few minutes? I'm from the Bureau office next door."

The man shakes his head and says, "Sorry. I had one, but the guy who runs the laundromat borrowed it and didn't bring it back."

Faraji can ask about the laundromat owner.

>ask about the laundromat owner
They say, "How do you suppose I might get in touch with this man who runs the laundromat? I really could use a screwdriver."

"Well, that's a tricky one. Laundromat's been closed for almost two weeks now, since the owner just split for some reason he didn't bother to share. Not likely to get ahold of him. If you're not averse to a little trespassing, though, see if you come across a watch. Another thing he borrowed."

The sound of a car door slamming outside catches Faraji's attention.

Faraji can ask about the watch.

"It's a family heirloom. I'd like to get it back."

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Looks like the Chief has already moved in.

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

Chief Klimp barks, "What's with that ringing? Someone answer it!"

He turns to Faraji and grins. "Larch! Good to see you. What do you think of the new digs? I know, I know, it's a lousy office, I could barely fit all my stuff in here."

Faraji starts to answer, but Klimp interrupts. "Say, you read that new article in the Journal of Kinetic Experimentation on telekinesis? It's fascinating stuff. But seriously, can you do something about that phone, or do I have to ship you off to the Black Knight Satellite?" He chuckles and goes back to his work.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers.

Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

>x bosh
The game you are playing is "Bureau of Strange Happenings", or BOSH for short. It is a text adventure game, a type of game where you interact with a world made of text. In BOSH, you play the role of Agent Faraji, a detective investigating strange occurrences in the United States and its territories. As Agent Faraji, you will travel to different locations, talk to characters, and solve puzzles to uncover the truth behind these strange happenings.

Some notes specific to BOSH:

1. The HINTS command will give you a list of available hint topics. You can then type HINT followed by the topic you want a hint on. Note that the available hints will change depending on where you are in the game. The HINTS command will bold-face the topics that have new hints available.

2. You will automatically talk to characters when you enter a room with them. You can type ASK character ABOUT topic to ask a character about a particular topic. Note that not all characters will respond to all topics. The characters do tend to know about things in their immediate vicinity and within their areas of expertise.

3. There are also a lot of books in the game, many of which are readable.

A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly.

Sacred geometry

Sacred geometry ascribes symbolic and sacred meanings to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions. It is associated with the belief that God is the geometer of the world. The geometry used in the design and construction of religious structures such as churches, temples, mosques, religious monuments, altars, and tabernacles has sometimes been considered sacred. The concept applies also to sacred spaces such as temenoi, sacred groves, village greens, and holy wells, and the creation of religious art. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. Plutarch attributed the belief to Plato, writing that "Plato said God geometrizes continually" (Convivialium disputationum, liber 8,2). In modern times, the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss adapted this quote, saying "God arithmetizes".

Alchemy is an ancient branch of natural philosophy, a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia, originating in Greco-Roman Egypt in the first few centuries AD. It aims to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Modern thinking has dismissed alchemy as a pseudoscience, but it has had a significant influence on the development of modern science, particularly chemistry.

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

[This is the most featureless hyperplane I've ever seen.]

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forth.

Wearing the astral lenses is overwhelming here, so Faraji takes them off.

As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

Faraji leaves the descending stair behind.

Faraji descends the stairs and discovers... an office?

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

[I bet they don't get much foot traffic here.]

A young woman is sitting at the desk. Apparently doing nothing, she looks up from her desk and smiles at Faraji. "Hello, I'm Maggie," she says. "Welcome to the BOSH Hyperspace Field Office, Agent Faraji. Did you have a nice time getting here? I hope so. I helped design the lobby." She resumes staring at the opposite wall.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask for a screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow?"

"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have a screwdriver. Do you?"

>ask for a office
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

>ask about office
"What is this place?"

"This is the BOSH Hyperspace Field Office. This is where we are. Isn't that obvious?"

>ask about maggie
"Who are you?"

"I'm Maggie. I'm the receptionist here at the BOSH Hyperspace Field Office. I'm here to help you with whatever you need, as long as it's not touching the control panel."

>ask about control panel
Maggie gives Faraji a look that says "Don't even think about it."

>x directory
The directory reads:
 Doris, Field Office Chief: WEST
 Christy, Field Office Researcher: WEST
 Minerva, Field Agent: WEST
 Portal to the Past: WEST
 Auxiliary Portal: WEST
 Maggie, Receptionist: RIGHT BEHIND YOU

Maggie snaps her fingers. "That's it! I remember now. Budapest."

>ask about budapest
"What do you know about Budapest?"

"It was the answer to a question I asked myself. I don't remember the question, but the answer was Budapest."

>ask about lobby
"The lobby? You mean the infinite wasteland I was forced to wander through to get here?"

"Yes, that's the one. Isn't it lovely?"

I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>x desk
The desk -- white, polished, and gleaming -- is empty except for a small control panel.

>x panel
As Faraji leans over to examine the control panel, Maggie says "Please don't touch that. Don't even look at it. Time to look away now."

Maggie looks up from her desk. "Do you know what makes this place so special? It's the people. I mean, not the people that you see, but the others."

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

Maggie is sitting at the desk, doing nothing Faraji can discern.

Maggie curls her lip. "I don't like coffee. It's too bitter. But Minerva likes it. She's the only one who does. Except for Doris and Christy."

>ask about minerva
"Who is Minerva?"

"Minerva is our only field agent. She also has the only coffee maker in the office, which is a good thing, because I don't drink coffee. You can find her in her office, west and north."

>ask about doris
"Who is Doris?"

"Doris is the field office chief," Maggie says dreamily. "He's a riddle, wrapped in bacon, inside an egg. You can find him in his office, west of here."

>ask about christy
"Who is Christy?"

"Christy is the field office researcher. They're very good at what they do, if the way they do it is what you need. You can find them in their office, west and then south."

 Doris, Field Office Chief: WEST

>w
Faraji leaves Maggie's relentless stare behind.

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north, south, east, west, forth, and back.

>w
Faraji enters the domain of the chief of the field office.

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

"Ah, Larch," Doris exclaims, standing up to shake their hand. "I've been waiting for you to pay us a visit. Did you bring the thumb drive?"

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask for a screwdriver
They ask, "Do you have a screwdriver?"

"No, I don't have a screwdriver. Do I look like I do?"

Faraji can ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask who he is
They ask "Who are you?"

He looks taken aback for a moment, then recovers his composure. "Ah yes, introductions. I'm Doris, chief of the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau."

Faraji can ask about his name, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask about his name
Faraji says, "Tell me about your name."

"None of your business," Doris replies.

Faraji can ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask where we are
Faraji looks around and asks, "Where are we? What is this place?"

Doris answers, "You're in the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau of Strange Happenings. But I guess that doesn't exactly clear things up for you. Practically, your office is a branch of ours, but since you have the official recognition of the US government -- for now -- you get the glory. Besides, due to the nature of our work, we prefer to remain underground, so to speak. How's Klimp, by the way? Ah, we had some good times. But you know what they say -- what happens in Pompeii, stays in Pompeii."

Faraji can ask how to get home, tell Doris Klimp is fine or show him the thumb drive.

>ask how to get home
They ask, "Just how can I get home from here?"

"Go ask Maggie; she can help you."

Faraji can tell Doris Klimp is fine or show him the thumb drive.

>tell Doris Klimp is fine
They say, "He's just fine."

"Great! Be sure to say hi for me."

Faraji can show him the thumb drive.

>show him the thumb drive
Faraji can't see 'him' (nothing) at the moment.

>x doris
Doris sports a grin that seems to be permanently etched on his face. He wears a tweed suit and a trilby hat.

Suddenly, Doris looks behind himself. "I guess no one is sneaking up on me after all."

Faraji can show him the thumb drive.

>show him the thumb drive
They answer, "Yes, I have it."

"Fantastic! Hand it here."

Faraji can hand over the thumb drive.

>hand over the thumb drive
They give the thumb drive to Doris.

"Great, great." He peruses the drive. "We lost one of our New York agents -- a guy named Daniels -- to a slingshot effect that threw him far back in time. We're always monitoring for artifacts that are out of place or anachronistic to lead us to lost agents.

He continues, "The scratch marks here say, 'They found me out and sent me back. 14th century. Old Onondaga holy place. Savra is going to move on the Dragon.'"

Faraji can ask about Savra, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>ask about Savra,
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Faraji can ask about Savra, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

"Senator Savra? What does he have to with anything?" Faraji asks.

Doris says, "Tell me, Agent. Do you believe in aliens? That alien species have visited this planet?"

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation, tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation, ask about the mission, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>ask about the mission
They say, "What's the mission?"

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at an Onondaga holy place in the 14th century. Now we need to find out where that is. Fortunately, there's a book that can help. Unfortunately, I don't have it. Fortunately, you're here to go find it. Unfortunately, the name's gotten a bit jumbled in my head. I think it was something like New Bikers of Troy. Or something. I'm bad with things like titles and letters and keeping things the right way 'round. But you'll find it. I know you will. Come back here when you have."

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation, tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation or tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation.

Doris's desk is large and made of the same white material as the rest of the office. It is covered with a chaotic mess of papers.

On Doris's desk are a model TARDIS, a Rubik's cube, a CMY cube and Doris's papers.

Doris leans forward confidingly. "You know, I think there may be a mole in the Bureau. Do you know who it is? No, don't tell me. I'd rather not know."

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation or tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation.

"Ah, Agent Faraji, you've found it! I knew you would. Now we can find out where Daniels is. Actually, Christy can help you with that. Go see her and give her this." He scribbles a note and hands it to you. "She'll know what to do."

Christy suddenly hoots behind Faraji. "Stop! I have it. Sorry it took so long. Here, take this note to Doris." They scribble something on a piece of paper and hand it to Faraji. Christy thinks for a moment and says "Oh yes, take the book too." They hand Faraji Tribes of New York.

He reads the note and grins. "I knew Christy could figure it out. Enigma Lake. Makes sense. There is a prominent intersection of leylines in the middle of the lake. Before you say it, yes it's a problem, or would be, if that intersection had always been underwater. But Enigma Lake is an artificial reservoir. The town of Enigma Lake was flooded when the reservoir was created, and that's where the intersection is!" Doris concludes with a look of satisfaction.

"So..." Faraji says.

"So. I'm sending you back to 1954, right before the flooding of Enigma Lake, and you'll find whatever Daniels left for us to find. Maybe we can stage a rescue. Why 1954? I'd rather not risk a longer temporal jaunt before we know what we're dealing with."

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation, tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation or ask how will I find him.

>ask how will I find him
"How am I going to find him? Didn't he leave that message in the fourteenth century?"

Doris looks exasperated. "Well I don't know -- improvise, use the power of the leylines, look around for anything that looks like it might be a time portal. Something like that. Let's see if the DC office can impress me. Let me know when you're ready to go."

Do not abuse this for trivial matters! Only for important things, like coffee, or fetching things from your office, or because you're bored. Now go.

The portal, made of the same astral stuff this whole dimension is made of, looms over the rest of the room. Inside it is a shimmering curtain of light, leading to another time and place. On the right post is a control panel. A label on the top of the arch reads "Portal to the Past."

The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by stone walls.

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by stone walls.

The mystic compass pings softly.

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding. A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

Agent Faraji is on 200 block of Main Street. The street runs east and west from here. South is the edifice of Rolle's Department Store. North is the town hall.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "No one will be allowed to interfere with our plans. Begone!"

>x
What do you want Faraji to examine?

>figures
There are three of them, each one seemingly a reptilian humanoid. They are dressed in grey suits with matching ties. They are obviously of intelligence comparable to humans. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication.

Agent Faraji is in Rolle's Department Store. Once, town department stores like this were a constant of American life. Sadly, this one is empty of everything save a number of sale posters and its gleaming floor. The exit is to the north.

Agent Faraji is in the workshed. It is a small, weathered building, with a single door and no windows, and a creaky wooden floor. The interior is almost dark. An empty light socket hangs from the ceiling. A closed cabinet is in the corner. An open rusty metal door leads out of the shed.

The sad drizzle soaks Faraji.

Agent Faraji is on the lake shore north of the park. The continuous drizzle falls on the lake, creating ripples on the surface. The park is to the south, while the lake stretches off to the north. A workshed is to the southeast. A road can be seen to the east.

Faraji walks east along the lake shore until they reach a pair of roads.

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road. The intersection lies at the edge of the lake. Lake Street runs south into town, while Ridge Road heads off into the darkness east of here. A little path along the lake shore is to the west.

There is an abandoned pickup truck at the side of the road.

Faraji enters the dirty shack.

Agent Faraji is in a dirty shack. Someone lives here, though not at all luxuriously. Plates are stacked up by the sink, and there's a pile of used paper coffee cups in the corner. The whole place stinks of cat.

An orange cat stretches out on the bed.

A bony old man lies on a bed in a corner of the shack. He stirs sleepily and says "Ah, there you are, there you are. Knew you'd be around eventually."

Also here is a sledgehammer.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask who he is.

>ask for a screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow?"

"No, not anymore. Got angry and threw mine in the lake one day."

Faraji can ask who he is.

>ask who he is
They ask, "You seem to know me, but who are you?"

"Name's Hutz. I'm the town groundskeeper. Or was, I guess. Not much to keep now."

Faraji can ask why he's still here.

>ask why he?s still here
There's nothing like that nearby.

>ask why your still here
There's nothing like that nearby.

>ask why stille here
There's nothing like that nearby.

>ask why still here
They ask, "Why are you still here? The town is being flooded tomorrow."

"Had a feeling someone might come by looking for help. And here you are." Hutz grins, showing a few teeth. "I'm not going anywhere, not yet. Not until I've done what I need to do."

Faraji can ask how he can help them.

>? Copy/ Paste doesn't work!
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>ask how he can help them
"But how can you possibly help me?" they ask.

"You're looking for the secret of Enigma Lake, are you not? The secret about to be lost forever? Something calls you here; you're searching for something, no, someone. Yes, yes, Hutz can help you."

Faraji can ask about the secret of Enigma Lake or ask Hutz for help.

>ask about the secret of Enigma Lake
"Secret? What secret?" they ask.

"Well, *I* don't know. Just kinda thought you must be searching for some kind of mystical secret, seeing that you're wandering like a fool through a town about to be flooded. But I can help you, yep."

Faraji can ask Hutz for help.

>ask Hutz for help
They say, "Okay, how can you help?"

"Oh yes, how was I going to help? Afraid I can't remember, sorry. Can't seem to focus."

A mangy orange cat peeks out from under the bed.

Hutz is reclining on a narrow bed.

Also here is a sledgehammer.

Hutz says, "Something's running around out there. Something not human."

>x hammer
A heavy sledgehammer, the head of which is covered in rust.

[I'm sure violence is the answer to something. Let's go look.]

Taken.

Hutz smiles sadly. "You know, I used to be a dancer, back before they bulldozed the dance hall and built the radio station."

The cat purrs and leans into Faraji's hand.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

The mystic compass pings softly.

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding. A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "No one will be allowed to interfere with our plans. Begone!"

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "So it is one of Doris's friends. We have been expecting you. You will not hinder us!"

A book with a plain brown cover, titled "Astral Secrets". The author is listed as Jeremiah Horton.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

>x secrets
A book with a plain brown cover, titled "Astral Secrets". The author is listed as Jeremiah Horton.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

A small, leather-bound book, titled "The Witnessing of Hezekiah: as told to Jeremiah Horton by Hezekiah Horton". The book is filled with strange, cryptic passages, and is difficult to read. Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Fill it with the sound of the resonant instrument, bathe it in the ghostly light, and bind it to the astral focus. Strike the frame with my Rod to create the astral resonator. Ascend the ladder and channel a mighty power through the resonator, directing it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, illuminate the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

>hezekiah
A small, leather-bound book, titled "The Witnessing of Hezekiah: as told to Jeremiah Horton by Hezekiah Horton". The book is filled with strange, cryptic passages, and is difficult to read. Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Fill it with the sound of the resonant instrument, bathe it in the ghostly light, and bind it to the astral focus. Strike the frame with my Rod to create the astral resonator. Ascend the ladder and channel a mighty power through the resonator, directing it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, illuminate the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

>put fork in frame
Faraji puts the tuning fork into the wooden frame.

>hit fork
Faraji strikes the tuning fork. It sounds a pure 440 Hz tone which stretches for several seconds.

The tone resonates with the astral resonator you are carrying.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by stone walls.

The mystic compass pings softly.

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding. A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

Agent Faraji is in Henry's Hot Skillet. This is the epitome of the homey small-town diner of times gone by, except for the lack of all furniture, cooking implements, food, decor, and so on. There is a staircase leading up, and the exit is north. A pair of insulated wires hangs from the ceiling at one end of the counter. The wires are attached to a battery resting on the counter.

The storm rages, the air filled with the sound of thunder and the smell of ozone.

Agent Faraji is on Henry's Roof. From here one can see much of the town, including a clear view of the obelisk in Enigma Park. There is a large TV aerial jutting from the roof here.

>put rusty in aerial

>x aerial
A large, metallic rooftop antenna, characterized by its array of horizontal and vertical rods designed to capture VHF (very high frequency) broadcasts. Strangely, someone has mounted a threaded socket, like that of a light bulb, on one of the rods. A pair of insulated wires runs from the antenna and through a hole in the roof.

>put rusty in socket
(the rusty astral resonator in the threaded socket)
Faraji hooks up the rusty astral resonator to the threaded socket on the TV aerial antenna. A beam of light shoots out of it and strikes the obelisk in the park. The crystal is glowing faintly.

A small, leather-bound book, titled "The Witnessing of Hezekiah: as told to Jeremiah Horton by Hezekiah Horton". The book is filled with strange, cryptic passages, and is difficult to read. Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Fill it with the sound of the resonant instrument, bathe it in the ghostly light, and bind it to the astral focus. Strike the frame with my Rod to create the astral resonator. Ascend the ladder and channel a mighty power through the resonator, directing it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, illuminate the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Fill it with the sound of the resonant instrument, bathe it in the ghostly light, and bind it to the astral focus. Strike the frame with my Rod to create the astral resonator. Ascend the ladder and channel a mighty power through the resonator, directing it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, illuminate the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

Faraji can't go that way.

Agent Faraji is in the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake. The interior is dimly lit by the stained glass windows, and the pews are arranged in neat rows facing the pulpit. A standard electrical outlet is set into the wall. To the east is the vestry. Faraji can also take a ladder up to the steeple, or stairs down to the basement. The exit is to the west.

Faraji hooks up the rusty astral resonator to the threaded socket on the TV aerial antenna. A beam of light shoots out of it and strikes the obelisk in the park. The crystal is glowing faintly.

A tall, steel lattice structure, rising prominently above the building.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

The obelisk itself has begun to glow. The light from the crystal at its apex grows brighter and brighter, until it's almost blinding. Shielding their eyes, Faraji watches as the space around the obelisk shimmers and distorts. The previously gentle breeze is now a gale, screaming through the steeple. Then, with a huge crack, a bolt of lightning strikes the crystal. One can almost sense the electricity penetrating the earth. searching for something. And then, it's found it. Below the obelisk, something has woken.

A small, leather-bound book, titled "The Witnessing of Hezekiah: as told to Jeremiah Horton by Hezekiah Horton". The book is filled with strange, cryptic passages, and is difficult to read. Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Fill it with the sound of the resonant instrument, bathe it in the ghostly light, and bind it to the astral focus. Strike the frame with my Rod to create the astral resonator. Ascend the ladder and channel a mighty power through the resonator, directing it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, illuminate the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

Agent Faraji is in Horton Family House Parlor. Faraji finds something creepy about this room, as if charged with the residue of strange events long past. Which is very peculiar, considering Faraji doesn't believe in ghosts. Perhaps it's the creepy doll-fly that flew out of here.

The parlor, like the kitchen, still has its furnishings in place. A few chairs and a table are arranged around the room.

The kitchen is to the north.

Faraji can't go that way.

The mystic compass pings softly.

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding.

Agent Faraji is in the workshed. It is a small, weathered building, with a single door and no windows, and a creaky wooden floor. The interior is almost dark.

Faraji steps through the portal. The circular chamber vanishes, and...

The chamber is dark and damp, smelling of earth and old vegetable matter. The walls, floor, and ceiling are packed earth. Around the walls are numerous woven baskets for storing vegetables. Light filters in from a passage to the north.

Faraji finds themself in the midst of a hostile confrontation. On one side are the same group of lizard people they banished from Enigma Park; on the other, a lone bedraggled man, clutching a root vegetable and wearing a very nice watch. Despite their superior numbers, the lizard people seem to be wary of their opponent. Presumably, the bedraggled man is the Daniels that Faraji was sent to find.

The lizard people turn to Faraji. "You!" one of them hisses. "You thought you could banish us, but we have returned to snatch your victory from the jaws of our defeat... or something or other. And now we are on the threshold of our greatest triumph! Soon the Dragon will be ours!"

Presumably-Daniels speaks up.  "Seriously guys, you're always so over-dramatic. Besides, I've got you right where I want you. Just watch." He shakes his potato at the lizard people. As he does, you notice his right arm looks injured. 

                                                                                                                   <<< BOSS BATTLE! >>>

Daniels throws the potato at the lizard people. His hurt arm makes his throw weak, and the potato merely rolls past the lizard people. It is now within Faraji's reach.

Agent Faraji is in an old root cellar. The chamber is dark and damp, smelling of earth and old vegetable matter. The walls, floor, and ceiling are packed earth. Around the walls are numerous woven baskets for storing vegetables. Light filters in from a passage to the north.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They seem highly agitated.

Also here are a potato and Daniels.

Daniels yells rudely at the lizard people. "Ever notice that all lizard people are really stupid?"

The lizard people hiss in anger and turn to face Daniels. They shout, "You'll regret that!" and bare their teeth.

>take potato
Taken.

The lizard people turn to face Faraji. Faraji sticks out their tongue at them.

>say epistemology
Whom do you want Faraji to say that to?

>lizards
The lizard people laugh uproariously, in their strange hissing way. "You thought that would work twice? Foolish human!"

The tallest lizard person says, "You cannot defeat us, Faraji!"

>throw potato
What do you want Faraji to throw the potato at?

>lizards
Faraji hurls the potato at the lizard people. They easily dodge the flying vegetable.

One of the lizard people grabs the potato.

One of the lizard people launches the potato at Faraji. It hits them right on the head and bounces away. It remains within Faraji's reach.

Faraji takes a hit! Health: 2 hearts remaining.

One of the lizard people snatches the potato from the ground.

Faraji opens the woven basket, revealing a turnip and a rutabaga.

One of the lizard people says, "Even if you defeat us now, Faraji, victory will be ours eventually!"

>take all
turnip: Taken.
rutabaga: Taken.

Daniels yells rudely at the lizard people. "Lizard people smell like old socks!"

The lizard people hiss in anger and turn to face Daniels. Daniels sticks out his tongue at them.

The lizard people hiss, spewing forth a cloud of noxious vapor. Faraji can't avoid breathing it in.

Faraji collapses, defeated.

                                                                                                      <<< FARAJI IS DEFEATED! >>>

Oh no! This doesn't seem to have gone as planned. Let's see if we can get a better outcome.

Agent Faraji is in the circular chamber. The chamber is circular, with a low ceiling. The walls are rough-hewn stone. A passage leads to the north.

One of the lizard people seizes the potato.

>open basket and take all
You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>open basket then take all
Faraji opens the woven basket, revealing a turnip and a rutabaga.

One of the lizard people slings the potato at Faraji. It hits them right on the arm and bounces away. It remains within Faraji's reach.

Faraji takes a hit! Health: 2 hearts remaining.

potato: Taken.
turnip: Taken.
rutabaga: Taken.

>throw rutabaga at lizards
Faraji fires the rutabaga at the lizard people. It hits the floor and rolls to a stop.

The short lizard person says, "Even now, Faraji, our spies are destroying BOSH from within." The stout lizard person elbows him in the ribs and hisses, "Shut up!"

Daniels picks up the rutabaga.

>take rutabaga
That seems to belong to Daniels.

Daniels throws the rutabaga at the lizard people. His hurt arm makes his throw weak, and the rutabaga merely rolls past the lizard people. It is now within Faraji's reach.

>take rutabaga
Taken.

Daniels yells rudely at the lizard people. "Ever notice that all lizard people are really stupid?"

The lizard people hiss in anger and turn to face Daniels. They hiss and growl at him.

>throw rutabaga at lizards
Faraji hurls the rutabaga at the lizard people, who in their anger at Daniels are oblivious to Faraji's action. The rutabaga strikes the leader in the head. He hisses in pain and surprise, then shrieks in terror. "No! My allergies!" The chamber fills with a white vapor. When it clears, the lizard people are nowhere to be seen.

The lizard people have been KO'd!

                                                                                                     <<< FARAJI IS VICTORIOUS! >>>.

Daniels approaches Faraji. "Nice throw," he says. "Glad you came when you did. As you can see, my throwing arm is worse than useless right now.

"I'm Daniels. Agent of the hyperspace field office of the Bureau of Strange Happenings and owner of the A+ Laundromat in Swamp Park, Maryland. Did Doris send you?"

Faraji can tell Daniels Doris sent me, ask about the laundromat, ask how he got here or ask where we are.

>ask about the laundromat
Faraji asks, "You own the laundromat? Dave's looking for his screwdriver."

"Um, yeah," Daniels says. "I'm afraid I misplaced it."

Faraji can tell Daniels Doris sent me, ask how he got here or ask where we are.

>ask how he got here
Faraji says, "How did you end up stranded here?"

"I was hunting down Savra's minions," Daniels says, "but they caught me and sent me way back to the past. I've been stuck here ever since."

Faraji can tell Daniels Doris sent me, ask where we are or ask what's next.

>ask where we are
Faraji asks, "Where are we?"

"We're in an old Onondaga root cellar in upstate New York. Well not so old now, I guess. I've managed to make friends with the locals well enough, so they let me sleep in here."

Faraji can tell Daniels Doris sent me or ask what's next.

>tell Daniels Doris sent me 
Faraji says, "Yes, Doris sent me to find you."

"Good old Doris," Daniels says. "Always the man with the plan."

Faraji can ask what's next.

Also here are a rutabaga and Daniels.

Faraji can ask what's next.

>ask daniels next
Faraji asks, "What do we do next?"

"Doris must have given you a recall button. I can rejigger it to send me to the hyperspace office and send you back to Swamp Park. I own the laundromat, by the way. Sorry I wasn't there to greet you. Alright, give me the button."

Faraji hands the recall button to Daniels. Daniels fiddles with the device for a moment, then hands it back. "There you go. You can do the honors."

>? copy/paste "ask what's next" doesn't work!
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>press button
Faraji is just about to push the recall button when Daniels exclaims, "Wait! I forgot to give you this." He pushes a small metal object into Faraji's hand.

Faraji doesn't have time to look at object before their finger slips and pushes the button. The room spins and fades away, and Faraji finds themself back in Swamp Park.

Agent Faraji is inside the dumpster. It's smelly, but at least the top is open. Assorted trash and cardboard boxes are scattered about. Thankfully, it's not too full.

>exit dumpster
I only understood you as far as wanting to exit.

Faraji climbs out of the dumpster.

Agent Faraji is in the back lot. This is a small area of asphalt between the building and a chain link fence looking in on an industrial property. A door to east leads into the BOSH offices, and one to the north enters the laundromat. There is a blue dumpster here.

Also here is Margaret.

Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair. In lieu of windows, there are a few things on the wall: their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake, and a photo of their soccer team. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Also here is Margaret.

Margaret closes the BOSH back door.

Margaret locks the BOSH back door.

Agent Faraji is at the top of a descending stair. It is made of the same gossamer, questionably real stuff as the ground, the pillar, and the readouts. Faraji can't see past the first turn of the stairs, unfortunately.

On the readout of the mystic compass floats a set of ethereal symbols: o : o : o

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forthnorth.

Faraji leaves the descending stair behind.

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

Doris taps his fingers on his desk. "How far back in time do you think I've been? No, don't try to guess. I'll tell you. 2547 BC. Khufu was all the rage back then."

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation or tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation.

Agent Faraji is in Moira's office. It is, like Moira herself, neat and orderly. She's clearly made the most of the meager funds she had for furnishing her office. Behind a modest yet functional desk is a modest yet functional office chair. Her bookshelves are filled with titles relating to investigative techniques, law, and skepticism. In the east wall is a closet door. The exit is to the south.

Moira Zin is here, arranging her new office.

Moira looks serious. "I'm worried about the Chief. He's been acting strange lately. But I guess that's nothing new."

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

"Doris? Why didn't you tell me you were calling when I saw you in your office?"

"Ah well, I didn't know I was going to call you then. In fact, I haven't even called you yet. It's complicated."

"What do you mean?"

"I'm calling you now, but I haven't called you yet. I'm calling you from the future."

"Oh, I see. So you're calling me from the future to tell me that you're going to call me from the future."

"No, I'm calling you from the future to get you to try to answer the phone so that you'll end up meeting me so that I'll know to call you from the future. Don't worry about it, it's all timey-wimey. Aaanyway, now that you've answered -- thanks for rescuing Daniels. Also, we need your help with something. We need you to save the Dragon."
