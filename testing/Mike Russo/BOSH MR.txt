>read basics
Welcome to the world of interactive fiction! This book will help you get started with the basics of playing interactive fiction, specifically those games known as "parser-based" games, or "text adventures." By getting here and reading this book, you've already taken the first step. Congratulations! Now, let's get started.

You're in a world made of text. Every turn you typically see a description of your surroundings, with which you can interact. You interact with this world by typing commands. The most basic command is to move around. You can do this by typing directions, such as "north," "south," "east," or "west." You can also use "up" and "down" to move vertically, and sometimes "in" and "out". You can also move northeast, southwest, etc.

You can also interact with objects in the world. You can type "look" to see the description of the room you're in. You can type "examine" followed by an object to get a closer look at it. You can type "take" or "get" followed by an object to pick it up. You can type "drop" followed by an object to drop it. You can type "inventory" or "i" to see what you're carrying.

You're in a safe place now, so go experiment! When you're ready to continue your adventure, PRESS THE BUTTON to leave this place and return to the real world. Good luck!

Which do you mean, Commands for the Novice Adventurer, Commands for the Intermediate Adventurer or Commands for the Advanced Adventurer?

>novice
This book will help you learn the basic commands you can use to interact with the world of interactive fiction. Here are some of the most common commands you can use:

LOOK (or L): This command will repeat the description of the room you're in. It's useful if you've forgotten what's around you.

EXAMINE (or X): This command will give you a closer look at an object in the room. You can type EXAMINE followed by the name of the object you want to look at.

TAKE (or GET): This command will allow you to pick up an object in the room. You can type TAKE followed by the name of the object you want to pick up.

DROP: This command will allow you to drop an object you're carrying. You can type DROP followed by the name of the object you want to drop.

INVENTORY (or I): This command will show you a list of the objects you're carrying. You can type INVENTORY to see what you're carrying.

GO (or MOVE): This command will allow you to move in a particular direction. You can type GO followed by the direction you want to move in. Alternatively, you can just type the direction (or an abbreviation) itself.

ASK: You can type ASK a character ABOUT a topic to ask a character about a particular topic. Note that not all characters will respond to all topics. If you're already talking to a character, you can just type ASK ABOUT followed by the topic.

OPEN: This command will allow you to open a container. You can type OPEN followed by the name of the container you want to open.

CLOSE: This command will allow you to close a container. You can type CLOSE followed by the name of the container you want to close.

UNLOCK: This command will allow you to unlock a locked object. You can type UNLOCK object WITH key.

LOCK: This command will allow you to lock a lockable object. You can type LOCK object WITH key.

SAVE: You can type SAVE to save your game. You can then type RESTORE to restore your game to the point where you saved it.

One of the most important things to remember is that simple commands are usually the best. The parser is designed to understand simple, direct commands. If you're not sure what to do, try typing a simple command and see what happens. Good luck!

>* that feels like a lot for "basics", maybe?  ASK and LOCK/UNLOCK feel like they could be saved for one of the others
Noted.

>read intermediate
This book will help you learn some intermediate commands you can use to interact with the world of interactive fiction. Here are some of the most common commands you can use:

PUT IN: This command will allow you to put an object in a container. You can type PUT object IN container.

PUT ON: This command will allow you to put an object on a supporter. You can type PUT object ON surface.

HINTS: If you're stuck, you can type HINTS to get a list of available hint topics. You can then type HINT followed by the topic you want a hint on. Note that the available hints will change depending on where you are in the game.

UNDO: You can type UNDO to undo your last move. Note that not all games support this command. This game does.

QUIT: You can type QUIT to quit the game.

>read strategies
This book will help you learn some strategies for playing interactive fiction. Here are some tips to get you started:

1. Explore: One of the most important things you can do in interactive fiction is to explore your surroundings. Look around, examine objects, and try different commands to see what happens. Don't get stuck in one place; keep moving and trying new things.

2. Take Notes: Interactive fiction can be complex, with many different locations, objects, and characters to keep track of. It's a good idea to take notes as you play, so you can remember important details and clues.

3. Talk to Characters: Many interactive fiction games have characters you can interact with. Try talking to them, asking them questions, and learning more about the world you're in. Characters can provide important information and clues to help you progress in the game.

4. Try Different Commands: Every once in a while, try typing a command you haven't tried before. You never know what might happen!

5. Don't Give Up: Interactive fiction can be challenging, but it's also rewarding. If you get stuck, don't give up. Try different things, explore new areas, and keep experimenting. You'll be surprised at what you can discover.

>read grammar
This book will help you learn some advanced grammar (and other) rules for playing interactive fiction. Here are some of the most common advanced grammar rules you can use:

1. Compound Commands: You can type multiple commands on one line by separating them with a period. For example, you can type TAKE KEY. UNLOCK DOOR to take the key and unlock the door in one turn. Using THEN instead of a period will also work.

2. Compound Objects: You can refer to multiple objects at once by separating them with "and". For example, you can type TAKE KEY AND LANTERN to take both the key and the lantern in one turn.

3. Abbreviations: You can use abbreviations for common commands. For example, you can type X KEY to examine the key, or L to LOOK. You can also use abbreviations for directions, such as N for NORTH, S for SOUTH, SW for SOUTHWEST, etc. Some other common abbreviations include I for INVENTORY, Z to WAIT, and G to do the same thing AGAIN.

4. Pronouns: You can use pronouns to refer to objects you've already mentioned. For example, if you've already mentioned the key, you can type TAKE IT to take the key. You can also use pronouns to refer to characters, such as HIM or HER or THEM.

5. Prepositions: You can use prepositions to specify how you want to interact with an object. For example, you can type PUT KEY IN BOX to put the key in the box, or GIVE KEY TO WALRUS to give the key to the walrus.

6. Shortened Names: You can usually refer to objects by part of their names. For example, you might refer to the Flying Purple People Eater as just PURPLE or FLYING or even EATER.

7. Synonyms: Sometimes you can use synonyms for names and commands, such as TORCH instead of FLASHLIGHT, or ATTACK instead of HIT.

>read bosh
The game you are playing is "Bureau of Strange Happenings", or BOSH for short. It is a text adventure game, a type of game where you interact with a world made of text. In BOSH, you play the role of Agent Faraji, a detective investigating strange occurrences in the United States and its territories. As Agent Faraji, you will travel to different locations, talk to characters, and solve puzzles to uncover the truth behind these strange happenings.

Some notes specific to BOSH:

1. The HINTS command will give you a list of available hint topics. You can then type HINT followed by the topic you want a hint on. Note that the available hints will change depending on where you are in the game. The HINTS command will bold-face the topics that have new hints available.

2. You will automatically talk to characters when you enter a room with them. You can type ASK character ABOUT topic to ask a character about a particular topic. Note that not all characters will respond to all topics. The characters do tend to know about things in their immediate vicinity and within their areas of expertise.

3. There are also a lot of books in the game, many of which are readable.

Agent Faraji is in the Observation Room. This small white room seems like a museum gallery, but with a window instead of art. Through the window you can see a lake at night, pelted by rain. Nothing can be seen through the storm-darkened waters.

A comfortable-looking viewing couch dominates the center of the observation room. Exits lead north and west.

You can type LOOK to repeat the description of the room. You can also EXAMINE an object to get a closer look at it. Or you can SIT ON THE COUCH. See what happens if you try to TAKE an object in the window.

Someone has left an umbrella on the couch.

>x lake
The lake is dark and stormy.

>x couch
The couch is soft and comfortable.

On the comfortable viewing couch is an umbrella.

The view through the window changes.

Through the window one can see a creepy looking place. It looks like the parlor of an old house, maybe Colonial era. There is a table with some chairs, with a book on the table. On the periphery of window, something insect-like flutters, largely out of view.

>x book
The book is too far away to read.

>take book
The book is on the other side of the window.

>x umbrella
A sturdy black umbrella.

You can type TAKE UMBRELLA to pick it up. Or you can OPEN UMBRELLA to open it..

>take it
Taken.

The view through the window changes.

Through the window one can see a blinding white space with impossible geometry. What looks like a structure of some kind is visible in the distance, but it's hard to make out the details.

>open it
Faraji would rather not risk bad luck by opening an umbrella indoors.

>n
Agent Faraji is in the ornamental garden. Flowers and shrubs crowd the paths. Faraji can leave to the south. A door leads west.

Sometimes things you need will be hidden. You can type EXAMINE FLOWERS to see if there's anything there.

>x flowers
The flowers are in full bloom.

Faraji notices a glint of metal among the flowers. It's a small brass key. They take it.

>x key

Doctor Helpful is a tweedy old professor with ink-stained fingers.

>ask doctor about himself
Faraji says, "Tell me about yourself, Doctor."

"I'm a tweedy old professor with ink-stained fingers," Doctor Helpful replies.

>ask doctor about me
Faraji says, "What do you know about me?"

"You're an agent investigating strange occurrences in the United States and its territories," Doctor Helpful replies.

>ask doctor about book
Faraji asks, "What book are you reading?

"I'm reading Advanced Adventuring, my latest book. It's a real page-turner. You should read it," Doctor Helpful replies.

Faraji can ask ask Doctor Helpful for the book.

>x book
This book will help you learn some advanced strategies for playing interactive fiction. Here are some tips to get you started:

1. Experiment: Interactive fiction is a genre that rewards experimentation. Try different commands, explore new areas, and interact with objects in creative ways. You never know what you might discover!

2. Pay Attention: Interactive fiction games are full of clues and hints that can help you progress. Pay attention to the details of the world around you, and take note of anything that seems important. You never know when a seemingly insignificant detail might turn out to be the key to solving a puzzle.

3. Think Outside the Box: Interactive fiction games often require you to think creatively and solve puzzles in unconventional ways. Don't be afraid to try something new or think outside the box. You might be surprised at what you can accomplish!

4. Use Your Inventory: The objects you carry can be important tools in solving puzzles and progressing in the game. Don't forget to use your inventory items when you get stuck. Try combining objects, using them in different ways, or giving them to characters you meet.

5. Ask for Help: If you're stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help. Many interactive fiction games have built-in hint systems that can provide you with clues and guidance. You can also ask other players for help on forums or social media. Don't be afraid to reach out!

6. Have Fun: Interactive fiction is a unique and rewarding genre of gaming. Don't be afraid to immerse yourself in the world of the game, explore new areas, and enjoy the experience. Remember, the most important thing is to have fun!

Faraji can ask ask Doctor Helpful for the book.

>ask doctor for book

Agent Faraji is in the Bureau of Special Help. It is bare save for a bookshelf and a button on the wall marked "Exit". Faraji can go east or north from here.

You can type EXAMINE BOOKSHELF to see what's on the shelf, or PUSH BUTTON to leave help. You can also type a direction (like EAST) to move around. Type LOOK to repeat the description of the room.

>push button
Faraji presses the button and finds themself back in the real world.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

>i
Faraji is carrying:

>x me
Agent Faraji is dressed smartly in a black suit, with neat hair and a serious expression. Inside, they are a punk rocker, a fact that they are not shy about.

[Don't talk about me like I'm not here.]

>* ooh triangle of identies tension!

>x phone
It's a pretty nice phone, only a couple of years old, but Faraji doesn't have time to play with it. They need to get to the office.

To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

>x office
Faraji gazes stoically at the sad little storefront that is the new BOSH office. The sign from the previous tenant is still up: "Angel's Department Store". Through the front window can be seen Margaret, in her usual manic work mode.

[I'm sure the Bureau will be back on its feet in no time.]

>x pawn
Faraji observes the pawn shop with obvious distaste. The flashing neon sign in the window advertises "Cash for gold!"

[I wonder if they take Bureau badges.]

>x margaret
Even from here one can sense Margaret's irrepressible energy.

[Better get in there and slow her down before she explodes.]

>x laundromat
Faraji peers through the windows of the laundromat at the rows of aging machines. A sign on the door says "Closed for renovations". They turn away, unimpressed.

[Looks like the renovations are going to take a while.]

>x car wash
Much like any other automatic car wash.

[These things sprout like weeds.]

>x swamp
Swamp Park is, as one might expect, dotted with these little bits of wetland.

[Swamp Park delivers on its name.]

>x car
(Faraji's Hyundai)
An old bright red Hyundai Accent, it's been their personal means of transportation for years. And since the Bureau lost its fleet, it's their work car too.

[They asked me if I wanted the flashy car, but I said no -- it just didn't fit my downscale image.]

>open car

>in
Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

[This place just screams "government efficiency".]

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

[I've known public restrooms that had better ambience.]

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

Faraji gives the pawn shop owner a curt nod.
"Hey," Dave says.

The pawn shop door closes.

To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

The pawn shop door closes.

Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

[This place just screams "government efficiency".]

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

>ask about phone
Faraji asks, "Tell me what's going on with the phones again?"

Margaret looks apologetic. "I'm sorry, I thought everyone knew. Budget cuts. They're trading in all our smart phones for cheaper models."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

Faraji enters their new office full of anticipation. Well, maybe dread is a better word.

Agent Faraji is in their office. They pause and survey the scene. It's not much -- four white walls, grey industrial carpet. Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

The scent of asphalt and old cigarette butts greets Faraji as they leave the office.

Agent Faraji is in the back lot. This is a small area of asphalt between the building and a chain link fence looking in on an industrial property. A door to east leads into the BOSH offices, and one to the north enters the laundromat. There is a blue dumpster here.

(first opening the pawn shop door)
Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

The pawn shop door closes.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask for a screwdriver
They lean on the counter and ask, "Do you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow for a few minutes? I'm from the Bureau office next door."

Faraji can ask about the laundromat owner.

>ask about owner
They say, "How do you suppose I might get in touch with this man who runs the laundromat? I really could use a screwdriver."

"Well, that's a tricky one. Laundromat's been closed for almost two weeks now, since the owner just split for some reason he didn't bother to share. Not likely to get ahold of him. If you're not averse to a little trespassing, though, see if you come across a watch. Another thing he borrowed."

Faraji takes a deep breath and enters the office of the Chief of BOSH.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Looks like the Chief has already moved in.

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

[It's like a museum of bad taste.]

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

Chief Klimp barks, "What's with that ringing? Someone answer it!"

He turns to Faraji and grins. "Larch! Good to see you. What do you think of the new digs? I know, I know, it's a lousy office, I could barely fit all my stuff in here."

Faraji starts to answer, but Klimp interrupts. "Say, you read that new article in the Journal of Kinetic Experimentation on telekinesis? It's fascinating stuff. But seriously, can you do something about that phone, or do I have to ship you off to the Black Knight Satellite?" He chuckles and goes back to his work.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

[I'm not sure I'd eat fruit from here.]

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

As you enter the store, you catch a glimpse of a red screwdriver in the glass case under the counter.

"Good morning," Faraji says.
"Yeah," replies the clerk.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair.

The Tunguska Event

The Tunguska event was a large explosion that occurred near the Stony Tunguska River in Yeniseysk Governorate, Russia, on the morning of June 30, 1908. The explosion over the sparsely populated Eastern Siberian Taiga flattened 2,000 square kilometers of forest, and is estimated to have had the force of 10-15 megatons of TNT, which is about 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.

The Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter, also known as the Hopkinsville Goblins case, occurred on the night of August 21, 1955, in rural Kentucky, USA. The Sutton family and their guests claimed to have encountered strange, small, metallic-looking creatures with large eyes and pointy ears, which they believed to be extraterrestrial beings. Throughout the night, the family reported being besieged by these entities, leading to a frantic shootout. Although there was no concrete evidence of the creatures" existence, the Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter remains one of the most famous and perplexing cases in UFO and paranormal lore, captivating the public's imagination and sparking ongoing debate among skeptics and believers alike.

Sacred geometry

Sacred geometry ascribes symbolic and sacred meanings to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions. It is associated with the belief that God is the geometer of the world. The geometry used in the design and construction of religious structures such as churches, temples, mosques, religious monuments, altars, and tabernacles has sometimes been considered sacred. The concept applies also to sacred spaces such as temenoi, sacred groves, village greens, and holy wells, and the creation of religious art. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. Plutarch attributed the belief to Plato, writing that "Plato said God geometrizes continually" (Convivialium disputationum, liber 8,2). In modern times, the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss adapted this quote, saying "God arithmetizes".

After a failed attempt to invade Athens, Atlantis sank into the ocean "in a single day and night of misfortune".

The text is written from left to right, and most of the pages have illustrations or diagrams. The Voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur cryptographers, including American and British codebreakers from both World War I and World War II.

Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by the alias Lenin, was a Russian revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924 and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party state governed by the Russian Communist Party. Lenin is known to have been involved in the occult, and to have been in contact with extraterrestrial beings. His Ouija board is said to be in the possession of the Russian government.

Levitation

Levitation is the process by which a mystic rises into the air, or floats in the air, without any physical support, and in a way that defies the laws of gravity. In addition, many UFOs are said to be capable of levitation.

The Dyatlov Pass Incident

The Dyatlov Pass incident was an event in which nine Russian hikers died in the northern Ural Mountains between February 1 and February 2, 1959, in uncertain circumstances. The experienced trekking group, who were all from the Ural Polytechnical Institute, had established a camp on the slopes of Kholat Syakhl when disaster struck. The hikers tore open their tent from the inside, fleeing in whatever they were wearing, and some were barefoot. The bodies showed no signs of struggle, but two had fractured skulls, two had broken ribs, and one was missing her tongue. The group's clothing contained high levels of radiation.

Klimp looks at the door and says, "You ever been to Siberia? They have lots of diners there, believe it or not. Or maybe I was in Pennsylvania. I can't remember."

A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

Also here is their computer.

A phone is ringing to the west.

Margaret arrives from the west.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Klimp's Porsche takes up two spots.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

(first opening the pawn shop door)
Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

The pawn shop door closes.

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

[This is the most featureless hyperplane I've ever seen.]

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forth.

Wearing the astral lenses is overwhelming here, so Faraji takes them off.

As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

A spiraling staircase disappears into the ground here. It is made of the same gossamer, questionably real stuff as the ground, the pillar, and the compass. Faraji can't see past the first turn of the stairs, unfortunately.

[So nice of them to point the way to the exit.]

>d
Faraji leaves the descending stair behind.

Faraji descends the stairs and discovers... an office?

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

[I bet they don't get much foot traffic here.]

A young woman is sitting at the desk. Apparently doing nothing, she looks up from her desk and smiles at Faraji. "Hello, I'm Maggie," she says. "Welcome to the BOSH Hyperspace Field Office, Agent Faraji. Did you have a nice time getting here? I hope so. I helped design the lobby." She resumes staring at the opposite wall.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>x maggie
Maggie seems a little vacant. She's staring at the wall.

[I think she's in a trance.]

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask her about herself
"Who are you?"

"I'm Maggie. I'm the receptionist here at the BOSH Hyperspace Field Office. I'm here to help you with whatever you need, as long as it's not touching the control panel."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask her for screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow?"

"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have a screwdriver. Do you?"

>x panel
As Faraji leans over to examine the control panel, Maggie says "Please don't touch that. Don't even look at it. Time to look away now."

[Geez, relax.]

Maggie curls her lip. "I don't like coffee. It's too bitter. But Minerva likes it. She's the only one who does. Except for Doris and Christy."

>i
Faraji is carrying:
  a mystic compass
  a large key
  a strange piece of paper
  a pair of astral lenses
  a thumb drive

>show drive to maggie

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

Maggie is sitting at the desk, doing nothing Faraji can discern.

>x desk
The desk -- white, polished, and gleaming -- is empty except for a small control panel.

[No stapler?]

Maggie gets up for a moment and paces. "Most people think my job is easy. But it's not. I have so many scary thoughts sitting here all day."

>x directory
The directory reads:
 Doris, Field Office Chief: WEST
 Christy, Field Office Researcher: WEST
 Minerva, Field Agent: WEST
 Portal to the Past: WEST
 Auxiliary Portal: WEST
 Maggie, Receptionist: RIGHT BEHIND YOU

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north, south, east, west, forth, and back.

[You can find blandness in any dimension.]

>n
Faraji enters an open office door.

Agent Faraji is in Minerva's office. The office is white and gleaming. A mahogany desk is in the middle of the room. A coffee maker sits on the desk.

[How did they get a big desk like that in here?]

Minerva is sitting at her desk, typing away on her computer.

Faraji says, "Hello, Minerva."
Minerva looks up briefly from her work. "Make it quick," she says.

Faraji can ask for a cup of coffee or ask for a screwdriver.

>x minerva
Minerva exudes an air of competence and no-nonsense business. Her expression is serious and focused.

Faraji pours themself a cup of coffee in a styrofoam cup from the coffee maker.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>x coffee
(the cup of coffee)
The coffee is steaming hot. It is in a paper cup.

[Finally, something to keep me awake through all this.]

Minerva, lost in thought, looks up. "Don't drink too much coffee. I pay for it, you know."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask her about screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow?"

"No."

>drink coffee
(the cup of coffee)
The coffee is too hot to drink.

>e
Faraji can't go that way.

Minerva looks bothered. "What is it now?"

>s
Faraji leaves Minerva to her work.

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north, south, east, west, forth, and back.

Faraji uneasily steps back into Maggie's domain.

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

Maggie is sitting at the desk, doing nothing Faraji can discern.

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north, south, east, west, forth, and back.

Faraji enters an open office door.

Agent Faraji is in Christy's office. Christy has taken the initiative to paint their office a bright, cheerful orange. A large desk is in the middle of the room.

[I think they're trying to blind us.]

Christy is sitting at the desk, drawing in a sketchbook.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

A sleek modern desk, it holds Christy's sketchbook.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

[I believe that kind of art is called abstract astigmatism.]

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>x christy

Christy sharpens her pencil. "Do you know how many donut shops there are in hyperspace? None! It's a travesty."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north, south, east, west, forth, and back.

Faraji enters the office of the chief of the field office. office.

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

[It's like a billboard advertising his insanity.]

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

"Ah, Larch," Doris exclaims, standing up to shake their hand. "I've been waiting for you to pay us a visit. Did you bring the thumb drive?"

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>x doris
Doris sports a grin that seems to be permanently etched on his face. He wears a tweed suit and a trilby hat.

[Nice hat. I'm not being sarcastic.]

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

He looks taken aback for a moment, then recovers his composure. "Ah yes, introductions. I'm Doris, chief of the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask about his name, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask him name
Faraji says, "Tell me about your name."

"None of your business," Doris replies.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask him where we are
Faraji looks around and asks, "Where are we? What is this place?"

Doris answers, "You're in the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau of Strange Happenings. But I guess that doesn't exactly clear things up for you. Practically, your office is a branch of ours, but since you have the official recognition of the US government -- for now -- you get the glory. Besides, due to the nature of our work, we prefer to remain underground, so to speak. How's Klimp, by the way? Ah, we had some good times. But you know what they say -- what happens in Pompeii, stays in Pompeii.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask how to get home, tell Doris Klimp is fine or show him the thumb drive.

>ask him about home
They ask, "Just how can I get home from here?"

"Go ask Maggie; she can help you."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, tell Doris Klimp is fine or show him the thumb drive.

Which do you mean, Chief Klimp or Chief Huffton Klimp?

>* oops!

I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>tell him klimp is fine
They say, "He's just fine."

"Great! Be sure to say hi for me."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or show him the thumb drive.

>ask for screwdriver
They ask, "Do you have a screwdriver?"

"No, I don't have a screwdriver. Sonic or otherwise."

Faraji can show him the thumb drive.

>show him drive
They answer, "Yes, I have it."

"Fantastic! Hand it here."

Faraji can hand over the thumb drive.

>give drive
(to Doris)
They give the thumb drive to Doris.

"Great, great." He peruses the drive. "We lost one of our New York agents -- a guy named Daniels -- to a slingshot effect that threw him far back in time. We're always monitoring for artifacts that are out of place or anachronistic to lead us to lost agents.

He continues, "The scratch marks here say, 'They found me out and sent me back. 14th century. Old Onandaga holy place. Savra is going to move on the Dragon.'"

Faraji can ask about Savra, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>ask him about savra
"Senator Savra? What does he have to with anything?" Faraji asks.

Doris says, "Tell me, Agent. Do you believe in aliens? That alien species have visited this planet?"

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation, tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation, ask about the mission, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

Doris twiddles his thumbs. "Have you ever been to Budapest? I haven't either. I hear it's full of Hungarians."

Faraji can tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation, tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation, ask about the mission, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>tell him they do believe in alien visitations
"Yes. The evidence is overwhelming," says Faraji.

Doris laughs. "Nonsense, all of it. Get it out of your head. The whole idea is ridiculous. Senator Savra is not an alien." he looks at Faraji significiantly.

They look at them unbelievingly. "What are you talking about?"

Doris shakes his head. "I thought you would know. He's a member of a race of Earth beings more ancient than our own. Agent Faraji, Senator Savra is a lizard man."

Faraji can ask what is a lizard man, ask about the mission, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

"Just what it sounds like. It's a bipedal, intelligent reptilian creature."

Faraji can remind him Savra's not reptilian, ask about the mission, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>ask about mission
They say, "What's the mission?"

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at an Onandaga holy place in the 14th century. Now we need to find out where that is. Fortunately, there's a book that can help. Unfortunately, I don't have it. Fortunately, you're here to go find it. Unfortunately, the name's gotten a bit jumbled in my head. I think it was something like New Bikers of Troy. Or something. I'm bad with things like titles and letters and keeping things the right way 'round. But you'll find it. I know you will. Come back here when you have."

Faraji can remind him Savra's not reptilian, ask about the mission, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

Disbelievingly, Faraji asks, "Time travel? For real?"

"Yes, yes," Doris responds. "Don't get too worked up over it. It gets old fast. But now we need to talk about the mission."

Faraji can ask about the mission.

Faraji takes a strange turn into a room labeled "Portal Room 1".

Agent Faraji is in Portal Room 1. The room is full of humming, glowing machinery, all of it attached to a large, arch-shaped portal in the middle of the room. The exit is back.

[The room is named well.]

The portal, made of the same astral stuff this whole dimension is made of, looms over the rest of the room. The portal is dark and inactive. On the right post is a control panel. A label on the top of the arch reads "Portal to the Past."

You exit the closet.

Agent Faraji is in Moira's office. It is, like Moira herself, neat and orderly. She's clearly made the most of the meager funds she had for furnishing her office. Behind a modest yet functional desk is a modest yet functional office chair. Her bookshelves are filled with titles relating to investigative techniques, law, and skepticism. In the east wall is a closet door. The exit is to the south.

Moira Zin is here, arranging her new office.

Agent Moira Zin is the very model of a competent Bureau agent. Hard-working, serious, no-nonsense but open-minded, she's the sober counter-balance to Klimp's sometimes childish credulity. Moira would clearly be a rising star if it weren't for the Bureau's pending dissolution.

[The problem with Moira is that she's too good at her job. Slow down and let the rest of us catch up, will you?]

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

Klimp jumps up from his chair, looks sheepish, and then sits back down. "Sorry, I was just thinking about Budapest. Scary place. Lots of ghosts. Lots of vampires. Lots of good food."

A phone is ringing to the south, in their office.

>w
Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair. In lieu of windows, there are a few things on the wall: their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake, and a photo of their soccer team. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Agent Faraji is in Moira's office. It is, like Moira herself, neat and orderly. She's clearly made the most of the meager funds she had for furnishing her office. Behind a modest yet functional desk is a modest yet functional office chair. Her bookshelves are filled with titles relating to investigative techniques, law, and skepticism. In the east wall is a closet door. The exit is to the south.

Moira Zin is here, arranging her new office.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

Also here is their computer.

A phone is ringing to the west.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Klimp's Porsche takes up two spots.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

Agent Faraji is in the back basement. The basement ends here. There is a switch on the wall, currently off. A doorway leads north.

A old broken-down washing machine peeks out from between two stacks of crates.

Also here is a handtruck.

>x machine
It's a front-loading model. The inside of the drum is obscured by a shimmering curtain of light.

There is a flash of light and Faraji finds themself somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is at the top of a descending stair. It is made of the same gossamer, questionably real stuff as the ground, the pillar, and the readouts. Faraji can't see past the first turn of the stairs, unfortunately.

On the readout of the mystic compass floats a set of ethereal symbols: o : o : o

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forthnorth.

Wearing the astral lenses is overwhelming here, so Faraji takes them off.

>d
Faraji leaves the descending stair behind.

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

Maggie is sitting at the desk, doing nothing Faraji can discern.

Maggie seems to snap out of her reverie. "Oh, hello. Who are you again? Oh yes, Agent Faraji. Please don't touch the control panel."

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

Faraji can ask about the mission.

>w
Faraji can't go that way.

Doris looks at Faraji brightly. "You ever need anything, ask Maggie. She's the best. She's the only one who knows what she's doing around here."

Faraji can ask about the mission.

>ask about mission
They say, "What's the mission?"

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at an Onandaga holy place in the 14th century. Now we need to find out where that is. Fortunately, there's a book that can help. Unfortunately, I don't have it. Fortunately, you're here to go find it. Unfortunately, the name's gotten a bit jumbled in my head. I think it was something like New Bikers of Troy. Or something. I'm bad with things like titles and letters and keeping things the right way 'round. But you'll find it. I know you will. Come back here when you have."

Faraji can ask about the mission.

>give book

"Ah, Agent Faraji, you've found it! I knew you would. Now we can find out where Daniels is. Actually, Christy can help you with that. Go see her and give her this." He scribbles a note and hands it to you. "She'll know what to do."

Christy accepts the coffee gratefully. "Thanks. I'll get to work on this right away. I'll let you know when I have something." They take a sip of the coffee and get to work, which seems to involve a lot of sketching and erasing.

Faraji can ask about the mission.

>give note

He reads the note and grins. "I knew Christy could figure it out. Enigma Lake. Makes sense. There is a prominent intersection of leylines in the middle of the lake. Before you say it, yes it's a problem, or would be, if that intersection had always been underwater. But Enigma Lake is an artificial reservoir. The town of Enigma Lake was flooded when the reservoir was created, and that's where the intersection is!" Doris concludes with a look of satisfaction.

"So..." Faraji says.

"So. I'm sending you back to 1954, right before the flooding of Enigma Lake, and you'll find whatever Daniels left for us to find. Maybe we can stage a rescue. Why 1954? I'd rather not risk a longer temporal jaunt before we know what we're dealing with."

Faraji can ask about the mission or ask how will i find him.

>* should "I" be capitalized here?
Noted.

>ask how will I find him
"How am I going to find him? Didn't he leave that message in the fourteenth century?"

Doris looks exasperated. "Well I don't know -- Improvise, use the power of the leylines, look around for anything that looks like it might be a time portal. Something like that. Let's see if the DC office can impress me. Let me know when you're ready to go."

Faraji can ask about the mission or tell Doris they're ready to go.

>* "improvise" shouldn't be capitalized Idon't think
Noted.

>tell doris I'm ready to go
Squaring their shoulders, Faraji says, "Ready to go."

Doris grins. "Great! First, you'll need this." He hands Faraji a small device. "In case you need to come back for any reason, press this button and you'll come back here. Do not abuse this for trivial matters! Time travel consumes valuable resources. Now go. Out of my office and to the forth you'll find the portal room. It's all ready to send you where you need to go."

Agent Faraji is in Portal Room 1. The room is full of humming, glowing machinery, all of it attached to a large, arch-shaped portal in the middle of the room. The exit is back.

The portal, made of the same astral stuff this whole dimension is made of, looms over the rest of the room. Inside it is a shimmering curtain of light, leading to another time and place. On the right post is a control panel. A label on the top of the arch reads "Portal to the Past."

>enter portal
Faraji enters the field of light, and they are suddenly somewhere else.

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding. A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Main and Lake. Main goes west, while Lake runs north. The corner of the town hall is to the northwest, although it cannot be entered there. Southeast is the entrance to WGXC "Galaxy" Radio. There is a broadcast tower on top of the building.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of wooden object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "Silly human. You will fail!"

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is walking on Solvay Road by the lake. Solvay Road runs by the lake shore here. It continues out of town to the northwest, while to the southeast it leads back into town. A dirty shack stands opposite the lake to the west. A path along the shore leads to the east.

Agent Faraji is in a dirty shack. Someone lives here, though not at all luxuriously. Plates are stacked up by the sink, and there's a pile of used paper coffee cups in the corner. The whole place stinks of cat.

[I'm not sure I want to know what's in the sink.]

A mangy orange cat peeks out from under the bed.

A bony old man lies on a bed in a corner of the shack. He stirs sleepily and says "Ah, there you are, there you are. Knew you'd be around eventually."

Also here is a sledgehammer.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask who he is.

>x man
The bony old man is more or less a skeleton in overalls.

[Kind of Crypt Keeper meets Groundskeeper Willie.]

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask who he is.

>ask who man is
There's nothing like that nearby.

>ask man who he is
They ask, "You seem to know me, but who are you?"

"Name's Hutz. I'm the town groundskeeper. Or was, I guess. Not much to keep now."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask why he's still here.

>ask him why
They ask, "Why are you still here? The town is being flooded tomorrow."

"Had a feeling someone might come by looking for help. And here you are." Hutz grins, showing a few teeth. "I'm not going anywhere, not yet. Not until I've done what I need to do."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask how he can help them.

>ask about help
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Hutz puts his arm under his head. "You're the first person to come by in a long time. Stay as long as you like."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask how he can help them.

>ask for screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow?"

"No, not anymore. Got angry and threw mine in the lake one day."

Faraji can ask how he can help them.

>ask how he can help
"But how can you possibly help me?" they ask.

"You're looking for the secret of Enigma Lake, are you not? The secret about to be lost forever? Something calls you here; you're searching for something, no, someone. Yes, yes, Hutz can help you."

Faraji can ask about the secret of Enigma Lake or ask Hutz for help.

>ask about secret
"Secret? What secret?" they ask.

"Well, *I* don't know. Just kinda thought you must be searching for some kind of mystical secret, seeing that you're wandering like a fool through a town about to be flooded. But I can help you, yep."

Faraji can ask Hutz for help.

>ask for help
They say, "Okay, how can you help?"

"Oh yes, how was I going to help? Afraid I can't remember, sorry. Can't seem to focus."

Faraji walks east along the lake.

Agent Faraji is at west end of the town's lake shore. The lake stretches to the north, while the town lies to the south. Solvay Road can be seen to the west, and the shore continues to the east.

[Haha, come and get me, lake. I dare you. Oh no -- have I regressed to taunting water?]

>n
The lake lies that way.

The rain falls in a steady rhythm.

Agent Faraji is on the lake shore north of the park. The rain falls steadily on the lake, creating ripples on the surface. The park is to the south, while the lake stretches off to the north. A workshed is to the southeast. A road can be seen to the east.

>e
Faraji walks east along the lake shore until they reach a pair of roads.

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road. The intersection lies at the edge of the lake. Lake Street runs south into town, while Ridge Road heads off into the darkness east of here. A little path along the lake shore is to the west.

[What ridge? I don't see a ridge.]

There is an abandoned pickup truck at the side of the road.

>x truck

Strangely, someone has mounted a threaded socket, like that of a light bulb, on one of the rods. A pair of insulated wires runs from the antenna and through a hole in the roof.

[I bet you kids don't even know what this is.]

Faraji heads back down the stairs to the restaurant.

Agent Faraji is in Henry's Hot Skillet. This is the epitome of the homey small-town diner of times gone by, except for the lack of all furniture, cooking implements, food, decor, and so on. There is a staircase leading up, and the exit is north. A pair of insulated wires hangs from the ceiling at one end of the counter.

The drizzle falls steadily, chilling the air.

Agent Faraji is on the corner of Main and Solvay. Main Street runs east from here, while Solvay Road heads north. South of here, Henry's Hot Skillet promises all of the comforts of the mid-twentieth-century diner. A bookstore named The Reading Room lies to the west, while Fresnel's Music is southwest.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the east, at the intersection of Main and Lake.

To the east, the shadowy figures move west, on the 200 block of Main Street.

Needing a little culture, Faraji heads into the music store.

Agent Faraji is in Fresnel's Music. The music store, like most of the town, is empty of all but a few items of little value. The exit is to the northeast.

[It's like John Cage's 4'33" in store form.]

A tuning fork lies on the counter.

A tuning fork, used to tune musical instruments.

[You know what's fun? Tapping a tuning fork and holding it to your teeth.]

Moralizing for Fun and Profit by The Reverend Jefferson Utz
Genre: Religious Self-Help

The Reverend Jefferson Utz's new book is a must-read for anyone who wants to make a quick buck by telling other people how to live their lives.

[Look, I'd really love to sit down and read a book, but I've got a phone to answer.]

>x brown
A book with a plain brown cover, titled "Astral Secrets". The author is listed as Jeremiah Horton.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

Agent Faraji is on the lake shore north of the park. The lake is dark and still, reflecting the overcast sky. The park is to the south, while the lake stretches off to the north. A workshed is to the southeast. A road can be seen to the east.

A light drizzle begins to fall, chilly in the night air.

>s
Faraji leaves the lake shore for the park.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. It's probably beautiful during the day, but tonight the deep shadows among the trees seem ominous. They are watchful and tense as they explore the park.

The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by stone walls.

[It's not Central Park, but it's not bad.]

>x obelisk
Its faux Egyptian design is incongruous adjacent to the adamantly traditional town hall. Faraji can just make out a small crystal adornment rising from the top.

[I don't know what it is, but obelisks always seem to be bad news.]

>x walls
Waist-high stone walls line the edge of the park.

>x crystal
From what Faraji can make out, it's a clear crystal held aloft by some kind of metal fitting.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of wooden object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "So it is one of Doris's friends. We have been expecting you. You will not hinder us!"

>e
The lizard people block the way.

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is in the broadcast booth. The broadcast booth is a small room with a window looking out into the rest of the station. A microphone is set up on a stand, and a soundboard is set into the wall. The exit is to the north.

A large, metallic rooftop antenna, characterized by its array of horizontal and vertical rods designed to capture VHF (very high frequency) broadcasts. Strangely, someone has mounted a threaded socket, like that of a light bulb, on one of the rods. A pair of insulated wires runs from the antenna and through a hole in the roof.

A book with a plain brown cover, titled "Astral Secrets". The author is listed as Jeremiah Horton.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

The mystic compass pings softly.

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding. A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

>n
Faraji pushes through the back door into the cool night.

The clouds obscure the moon.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by stone walls.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of wooden object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "No one will be allowed to interfere with our plans. Begone!"

>s
The lizard people block the way.

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Main and Lake. Main goes west, while Lake runs north. The corner of the town hall is to the northwest, although it cannot be entered there. Southeast is the entrance to WGXC "Galaxy" Radio. There is a broadcast tower on top of the building.

To the west, the shadowy figures move out of view to the southwest, from Main and Solvay, into the music store.

>x tower
A tall, steel lattice structure, rising prominently above the building. This kind of tower was designed to maximize the height for better signal transmission and reception in the era before widespread cable and satellite technology. Strangely, the bars of the tower near roof-level are bent inward to form a small platform. It's almost as if something is meant to be mounted there.

[What a great place to get struck by lightning.]

To the south, the shadowy figures move south, walking on Lake Street by the gym.

>out
Faraji gets out of the abandoned pickup truck.

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road. The intersection lies at the edge of the lake. Lake Street runs south into town, while Ridge Road heads off into the darkness east of here. A little path along the lake shore is to the west.

There is an abandoned pickup truck at the side of the road.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the south, walking on Lake Street by the gym.

To the south, the shadowy figures move north, walking on Lake Street by the park.

>x truck
(the abandoned pickup truck)
The truck, a Ford F-1, is relatively new, with no sign as to why it was abandoned. The tailgate is up. The hood is slightly crumpled, as if it has been in a minor accident.

To the south, the shadowy figures move out of view to the west, from Lake Street by the park, into the park.

>x hood
The hood is slightly crumpled, as if it has been in a minor accident. It is closed.

>open hood
Faraji opens the truck hood, revealing a dirty car battery.

>* aha!
Noted.

>x battery
The battery is dirty and corroded. Acid has leaked from the terminals. It's unlikely to be of any use.

[I wonder if it's still under warranty.]

>take it
With so much acid on the battery, it's probably best not to touch it with bare hands.

Agent Faraji is in Henry's Hot Skillet. This is the epitome of the homey small-town diner of times gone by, except for the lack of all furniture, cooking implements, food, decor, and so on. There is a staircase leading up, and the exit is north. A pair of insulated wires hangs from the ceiling at one end of the counter.

The rain falls steadily, soaking the ground.

Agent Faraji is on Henry's Roof. From here one can see much of the town, including a clear view of the obelisk in Enigma Park. There is a large TV aerial jutting from the roof here.

>put resonator in socket
Faraji screws the rusty astral resonator into the threaded socket on the TV aerial antenna.

>x resonator
A small, rusty, metallic, cylindrical object. One end is capped with a lens, while the other terminates in a threaded base, like a light bulb.

>x lens
(the pair of astral lenses)
To all appearances an ordinary pair of glasses, the astral lenses allegedly reveal the existence of extra-dimensional pathways.

To the north, the shadowy figures move south, on the corner of Main and Solvay.

>read secrets
A book with a plain brown cover, titled "Astral Secrets". The author is listed as Jeremiah Horton.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

A tall, steel lattice structure, rising prominently above the building. This kind of tower was designed to maximize the height for better signal transmission and reception in the era before widespread cable and satellite technology.

The mystic compass pings softly.

Agent Faraji is walking on Solvay Road by the lake. Solvay Road runs by the lake shore here. It continues out of town to the northwest, while to the southeast it leads back into town. A dirty shack stands opposite the lake to the west. A path along the shore leads to the east.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of wooden object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "Silly human. You will fail!"
