Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Main and Lake. Main goes west, while Lake runs north. The corner of the town hall is to the northwest, although it cannot be entered there. Southeast is the entrance to WGXC "Galaxy" Radio. There is a broadcast tower on top of the building.

To the west, some shadowy figures come into view from the north, on the corner of Main and Solvay.

Agent Faraji is in Radio Station WGXC. This is the town radio station. South is the entrance to the broadcast booth. A staircase runs upwards, presumably to the roof and the broadcast antenna. The exit is northwest.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of wooden object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "Surface vermin! You will not stop us!"

Agent Faraji is in the church basement. The basement is a shock to behold after the simple church above. It's a large, open space, with walls painted with scenes of humans and lizard people in battle, with aliens and platypuses looking on in horror. There is an ornate altar at the far end of the room. The exit is up.

The extension cord you are carrying trails up into the church.

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road. The intersection lies at the edge of the lake. Lake Street runs south into town, while Ridge Road heads off into the darkness east of here. A little path along the lake shore is to the west.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of wooden object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "So it is one of Doris's friends. We have been expecting you. You will not hinder us!"

There is an abandoned pickup truck at the side of the road. The hood is open.

>say postmodernism
(to the group of lizard people)
At your word, the lizard people scream and hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. When the vapor clears, they are gone, but they have left something behind. There is a wooden frame on the ground!

[Yes, run away, you stupid... lizard people!]

>x frame
(the wooden frame)
A piece of wood, about two feet long with three holes carved in it. It looks like the holes are meant to hold things. Leather straps appear to be meant to hold those things in the frame.

[This couldn't possibly be useful. I should just leave it here.]

>take it

>s
Agent Faraji is in Henry's Hot Skillet. This is the epitome of the homey small-town diner of times gone by, except for the lack of all furniture, cooking implements, food, decor, and so on. There is a staircase leading up, and the exit is north. A pair of insulated wires hangs from the ceiling at one end of the counter.

A tall, steel lattice structure, rising prominently above the building. This kind of tower was designed to maximize the height for better signal transmission and reception in the era before widespread cable and satellite technology. Strangely, the bars of the tower near roof-level are bent inward to form a small platform. It's almost as if something is meant to be mounted there.

A book with a plain brown cover, titled "Astral Secrets". The author is listed as Jeremiah Horton.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

Faraji can ask about the mission.

>ask about mission
They say, "What's the mission?"

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at an Onandaga holy place in the 14th century. Now we need to find out where that is. Fortunately, there's a book that can help. Unfortunately, I don't have it. Fortunately, you're here to go find it. Unfortunately, the name's gotten a bit jumbled in my head. I think it was something like New Bikers of Troy. Or something. I'm bad with things like titles and letters and keeping things the right way 'round. But you'll find it. I know you will. Come back here when you have."

Faraji can ask about the mission.

Agent Faraji is in Moira's office. It is, like Moira herself, neat and orderly. She's clearly made the most of the meager funds she had for furnishing her office. Behind a modest yet functional desk is a modest yet functional office chair. Her bookshelves are filled with titles relating to investigative techniques, law, and skepticism. In the east wall is a closet door. The exit is to the south.

Moira Zin is here, arranging her new office.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm.

Also here is Faraji's computer.

Agent Faraji is in Horton Family House Kitchen. The house is a modest colonial-period building. Strangely, the furnishings of the house have been left in place, despite the coming flood. An open hearth is in the center of the room, with a few chairs and a table. The parlor is to the south, and a narrow staircase leads up. To the east the front door leads out to Solvay Road, while another exit leads west to the family graveyard.

Faraji carefully climbs the dubious stairs.

Agent Faraji is in the Second Floor of the Horton House. The second floor is a small, cramped space, with a single window looking out over the front yard. A small bed sits in one corner, while a closed wardrobe stands against a wall. A staircase leads down.

>x witnessing
A small, leather-bound book, titled "The Witnessing of Hezekiah: as told to Jeremiah Horton by Hezekiah Horton". The book is filled with strange, cryptic passages, and is difficult to read. Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Then take the resonant instrument, and with reverence, bind it to the ghostly light, and then to the astral focus. Ascend the ladder and, channeling a mighty power through the resonator, direct it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, strike the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

The storm rages, the wind howling and the rain falling in sheets.

Agent Faraji is in the Horton graveyard. It is riddled with holes where the bodies have been exhumed for the coming flood. Likewise, the gravestones have been removed, leaving only the holes. The Horton family house is to the east.

Faraji's footsteps creak on the wooden floor as they enter the parlor.

Upon entering the parlor, Faraji is attacked by a horrible flying creature with the body of a doll and the head of a fly! They wave it away and it flies out of the room to the north.

Agent Faraji is in Horton Family House Parlor. Faraji finds something creepy about this room, as if charged with the residue of strange events long past. Which is very peculiar, considering Faraji doesn't believe in ghosts. Perhaps it's the creepy doll-fly that flew out of here.

The parlor, like the kitchen, still has its furnishings in place. A few chairs and a table are arranged around the room. A strange-looking book is on the table.

Flipping through the book, it appears that each page consists of a name, a drawing of a strange creature, and below that a word in a strange, unknown language. The text is written in a spidery, crabbed hand, and is difficult to read.

Faraji stops on one that reads Asgth the Unreasonable above a drawing of a wasp with the earlobes of a bee, below which is written Zigog Shakashakazor.
 
Faraji can also LOOK UP a creature name IN THE BOOK OF WEIRD NAMES to see the creature and incantation.

Faraji emerges from the astral tunnel into the fire station.

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

Doris looks at Faraji. "You know, I've been thinking about getting a dog. What do you think? No don't tell me. You might say the opposite of what I want to hear."

Faraji can ask about the mission.

Agent Faraji is in the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake. The interior is dimly lit by the stained glass windows, and the pews are arranged in neat rows facing the pulpit. A standard electrical outlet is set into the wall. To the east is the vestry. You can also take a ladder up to the steeple, or stairs down to the basement. The exit is to the west.

An extension cord lies on the floor, one end plugged into the electrical outlet. The other end trails west out of the church.

Faraji manages to make the makeshift astral resonator fit in the tripod's mount. The beam of light focuses on the obelisk in the park, striking the crystal adornment at its apex. The crystal is glowing brilliantly.

All of a sudden the obelisk itself begins to glow. The light from the crystal at its apex grows brighter and brighter, until it's almost blinding. Shielding their eyes, Faraji watches as the space around the obelisk shimmers and distorts. The previously gentle breeze is now a gale, screaming through the steeple. Then, with a huge crack, a bolt of lightning strikes the crystal. One can almost sense the electricity penetrating the earth. searching for something. And then, it's found it. Below the obelisk, something has woken.

>read hezekiah
A small, leather-bound book, titled "The Witnessing of Hezekiah: as told to Jeremiah Horton by Hezekiah Horton". The book is filled with strange, cryptic passages, and is difficult to read. Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Then take the resonant instrument, and with reverence, bind it to the ghostly light, and then to the astral focus. Ascend the ladder and, channeling a mighty power through the resonator, direct it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, strike the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

This portal seems to be natural, if that's indeed a possibility. It's a shimmering white oval, about six feet high and four feet wide. It's not clear where it leads.

[Another goldang portal. Could someone at least label where they go?]

>enter portal
Faraji steps through the portal. The circular chamber vanishes, and they find themself somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is in an old root cellar. The chamber is dark and damp, smelling of earth and old vegetable matter. The walls, floor, and ceiling are packed earth. Around the walls are numerous woven baskets for storing vegetables. Light filters in from a passage to the north.

[Oh good, another cave, only this one smells like beets.]

A tired-looking man sits on the floor of the cellar. He looks up as Faraji appears. "Ah, you must be the help I was promised," he says. "I'm Daniels. I've been waiting for you."

Faraji can ask where we are or ask what's next.

>ask where we are
Faraji asks, "Where are we?"

"We're in an old Onandaga root cellar in upstate New York. Well not so old now, I guess. I've managed to make friends with the locals well enough, so they let me sleep in here."

Faraji can ask what's next.

>ask what's next
Faraji asks, "What do we do next?"

"Doris must have given you a recall button. I can rejigger it to send me to the hyperspace office and send you back to Swamp Park. I own the laundromat, by the way. Sorry I wasn't there to greet you. Alright, give me the button."

Faraji hands the recall button to Daniels. Daniels fiddles with the device for a moment, then hands it back. "There you go. You can do the honors."

>* how does he know about the laundromat?
Noted.

>push button
Faraji is just about to push the recall button when Daniels exclaims, "Wait! I forgot to give you this." He pushes a small metal object into Faraji's hand.

Faraji doesn't have time to look at object before their finger slips and pushes the button. The room spins and fades away, and Faraji finds themself back in Swamp Park.

Agent Faraji is inside the dumpster. It's smelly, but at least the top is open. Assorted trash and cardboard boxes are scattered about. Thankfully, it's not too full.

[I'll get that guy Daniels for this.]

>out
Faraji climbs out of the dumpster.

Agent Faraji is in the back lot. This is a small area of asphalt between the building and a chain link fence looking in on an industrial property. A door to east leads into the BOSH offices, and one to the north enters the laundromat. There is a blue dumpster here.

The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

Also here is their computer.

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji trips over a newspaper left up against the door. They pick it up.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Klimp's Porsche takes up two spots.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby. The hood is open.

(first opening the pawn shop door)
Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

Dave looks at the ceiling. "You know, I've been thinking about getting another tattoo. I think this one will be Snorlax."

The pawn shop door closes.

>give watch to dave

Dave smiles when Faraji hands him the watch. "I've been looking for this," he says. "Here you go, five bucks for your trouble." He hands them a Li'l Nectarine Gift Card.

To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Klimp's Porsche takes up two spots.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby. The hood is open.

Also here is a copy of the Washington Herald.

The pawn shop door closes.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

>give card to clerk
They don't seem interested in that.

>buy screwdriver
What do you want Faraji to buy the red screwdriver with?

>card
The clerk takes the gift card and hands you the red screwdriver. "Thanks," he says.

>x screwdriver
A medium-length flat head screwdriver with a red plastic handle.

[There it is, just a few inches away, yet so far.]

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

Also here is their computer.

A phone is ringing to the west.

>unscrew grate
There's nothing like that nearby.

>look behind desk
There are a number of shelves of office supplies behind the desk. There is also a heating vent on the floor here.

A phone is ringing to the west.

>unscrew vent
It is fixed in place.

A phone is ringing to the west.

>x vent
A typical air register with a grill which one would hope would stop things like, say, a hex wrench from falling through. It's set in the floor behind the front desk. The vent is held closed by four screws.

In the heating vent is a hex wrench.

>unscrew screws
Faraji unscrews the four screws and removes the vent cover. They take the hex wrench from inside and put the cover back on.

Margaret arrives from the west.

>x wrench
The ubiquitous flat pack furniture tool.

[There are approximately 5 billion of these shipped to the US from Sweden every year, yet this is the only one I can find.]

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. All of the doors are open.

A phone is ringing to the south, in their office.

Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair. In lieu of windows, there are a few things on the wall: their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake, and a photo of their soccer team. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

>disassemble desk
Faraji unscrews the hex screws and removes the drawer. Inside, they find a little grey key and a blue flipphone. They put the drawer back together and pocket the key and the phone, being careful to leave the drawer unlocked.

The blue flipphone you are carrying is ringing.

>x phone
Faraji doesn't recognize the number on the caller ID.

The blue flipphone you are carrying is ringing.

>take i
There's nothing like that nearby.

>take it
Faraji already has that.

The blue flipphone you are carrying is ringing.

>answer it
Faraji answers the blue flipphone.
They say hello.


"Hello?"

"Hello, Larch," says a familiar voice -- it's Doris.

"Doris? Why didn't you tell me you were calling when I saw you in your office?"

"Ah well, I didn't know I was going to call you then. In fact, I haven't even called you yet. It's complicated."

"What do you mean?"

"I'm calling you now, but I haven't called you yet. I'm calling you from the future."

"Oh, I see. So you're calling me from the future to tell me that you're going to call me from the future."

"No, I'm calling you from the future to get you to try to answer the phone so that you'll end up meeting me so that I'll know to call you from the future. Don't worry about it, it's all timey-wimey. Aaanyway, now that you've answered -- thanks for rescuing Daniels. Also, we need your help with something. We need you to save the Dragon." 


    *** Congratulations on answering the phone! ***


Larch Faraji will return in "BOSH II: The Dragon".

[Seriously, is that it?]
