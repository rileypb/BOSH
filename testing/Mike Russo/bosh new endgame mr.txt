Agent Faraji is in the circular chamber. The chamber is circular, with a low ceiling. The walls are rough-hewn stone. A passage leads to the north.

A shimmering portal hovers in the center of the chamber, casting a faint light over the room.

>* just did the cheat
Noted.

>enter portal
Faraji steps through the portal. The circular chamber vanishes, and...

The chamber is dark and damp, smelling of earth and old vegetable matter. The walls, floor, and ceiling are packed earth. Around the walls are numerous woven baskets for storing vegetables. Light filters in from a passage to the north.

Faraji finds themself in the midst of a hostile confrontation. On one side are the same group of lizard people they banished from Enigma Park; on the other, a lone bedraggled man, clutching a root vegetable and wearing a very nice watch. Despite their superior numbers, the lizard people seem to be wary of their opponent. Presumably, the bedraggled man is the Daniels that Faraji was sent to find.

The lizard people turn to Faraji. "You!" one of them hisses. "You thought you could banish us, but we have returned to snatch your victory from the jaws of our defeat... or something or other. And now we are on the threshold of our greatest triumph! Soon the Dragon will be ours!"

Presumably-Daniels speaks up.  "Seriously guys, you're always so over-dramatic. Besides, I've got you right where I want you. Just watch." He shakes his potato at the lizard people. As he does, you notice his right arm looks injured. 

                  <<< BOSS BATTLE! >>>

Daniels throws the potato at the lizard people. His hurt arm makes his throw weak, and the potato merely rolls past the lizard people. It is now within Faraji's reach.

  The Ecology of Root Vegetables
  a recall button
  a green smartphone

>read ecology
A book with a green cover, titled "The Ecology of Root Vegetables". The author is listed as Dr. A. Zilman. The book is a comprehensive study of root vegetables. There is a whole chapter on the rutabaga, including its history, cultivation, and uses in various cultures. One strange passage details its use as a weapon against "evil earth demons".

The short lizard person says, "Even now, Faraji, our spies are destroying BOSH from within." The stout lizard person elbows him in the ribs and hisses, "Shut up!"

>* interesting!  Not sure if that was in the original version, but a helpful cue
Noted.

>throw potato at lizards
Faraji fires the potato at the lizard people. It hits the floor and rolls to a stop.

One of the lizard people says, "Even if you defeat us now, Faraji, victory will be ours eventually!"

>x daniels
Daniels looks weary. He's dressed in a tattered suit, and his hair is unkempt.

The lizard people hiss, spewing forth a cloud of noxious vapor. Faraji can't avoid breathing it in.

Faraji collapses, defeated.

              <<< FARAJI IS DEFEATED! >>>

Oh no! This doesn't seem to have gone as planned. Let's see if we can get a better outcome.

>lizards
The lizard people seem to find your words amusing. They hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road. The intersection lies at the edge of the lake. Lake Street runs south into town, while Ridge Road heads off into the darkness east of here. A little path along the lake shore is to the west.

There is an abandoned pickup truck at the side of the road.

The sky clouds over, and the air grows cooler. The moon disappears behind a veil of clouds.

The world turns inside out, and suddenly Faraji is somewhere else.

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

"Ah, Larch," Doris exclaims, standing up to shake their hand. "I've been waiting for you to pay us a visit. Did you bring the thumb drive?"

Faraji can ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or ask what thumb drive.

Agent Faraji is in an old root cellar. The chamber is dark and damp, smelling of earth and old vegetable matter. The walls, floor, and ceiling are packed earth. Around the walls are numerous woven baskets for storing vegetables. Light filters in from a passage to the north.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They seem highly agitated.

Also here is Daniels.

>x baskets
The basket is woven from reeds. It's closed.

There's nothing like that nearby.

Faraji opens the woven basket, revealing a turnip and a rutabaga.

turnip: Taken.
rutabaga: Taken.

Daniels yells rudely at the lizard people. "Gah! What is that smell?"

The lizard people hiss in anger and turn to face Daniels. They retort, "Sticks and stones!" and stamp their feet.

>throw rutabega at lizards
There's nothing like that nearby.

>throw rutabaga at lizards
Faraji hurls the rutabaga at the lizard people, who in their anger at Daniels are oblivious to Faraji's action. The rutabaga strikes the leader in the head. He hisses in pain and surprise, then shrieks in terror. "No! My allergies!" The chamber fills with a white vapor. When it clears, the lizard people are nowhere to be seen.

The lizard people have been KO'd!

             <<< FARAJI IS VICTORIOUS! >>>.

Daniels approaches Faraji. "Nice throw," he says. "Glad you came when you did. As you can see, my throwing arm is worse than useless right now.

"I'm Daniels. Agent of the hyperspace field office of the Bureau of Strange Happenings and owner of the A+ Laundromat in Swamp Park, Maryland. Did Doris send you?"

Faraji can tell Daniels Doris sent me, ask about the laundromat, ask how he got here or ask where we are.

>yes
Faraji says, "Yes, Doris sent me to find you."

"Good old Doris," Daniels says. "Always the man with the plan."

Faraji can ask about the laundromat, ask how he got here or ask where we are.

>x daniels
Daniels looks weary. He's dressed in a tattered suit, and his hair is unkempt.

Faraji can ask about the laundromat, ask how he got here or ask where we are.

>ask him about laundromat
Faraji asks, "You own the laundromat? Dave's looking for his screwdriver."

"Um, yeah," Daniels says. "I'm afraid I misplaced it."

Faraji can ask how he got here or ask where we are.

>ask him how he got here
Faraji says, "How did you end up stranded here?"

"I was hunting down Savra's minions," Daniels says, "but they caught me and sent me way back to the past. I've been stuck here ever since."

Faraji can ask where we are or ask what's next.

>ask him where we are
Faraji asks, "Where are we?"

"We're in an old Onondaga root cellar in upstate New York. Well not so old now, I guess. I've managed to make friends with the locals well enough, so they let me sleep in here."

Faraji can ask what's next.

>ask him what's next
Faraji asks, "What do we do next?"

"Doris must have given you a recall button. I can rejigger it to send me to the hyperspace office and send you back to Swamp Park. I own the laundromat, by the way. Sorry I wasn't there to greet you. Alright, give me the button."

Faraji hands the recall button to Daniels. Daniels fiddles with the device for a moment, then hands it back. "There you go. You can do the honors."

>push button
Faraji is just about to push the recall button when Daniels exclaims, "Wait! I forgot to give you this." He pushes a small metal object into Faraji's hand.

Faraji doesn't have time to look at object before their finger slips and pushes the button. The room spins and fades away, and Faraji finds themself back in Swamp Park.

Agent Faraji is inside the dumpster. It's smelly, but at least the top is open. Assorted trash and cardboard boxes are scattered about. Thankfully, it's not too full.

Faraji climbs out of the dumpster.

Agent Faraji is in the back lot. This is a small area of asphalt between the building and a chain link fence looking in on an industrial property. A door to east leads into the BOSH offices, and one to the north enters the laundromat. There is a blue dumpster here.

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north, south, east, west, forth, and back.

Faraji uneasily steps back into Maggie's domain.

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

[I bet they don't get much foot traffic here.]

A young woman is sitting at the desk. Apparently doing nothing, she looks up from her desk and smiles at Faraji. "Hello, I'm Maggie," she says. "Welcome to the BOSH Hyperspace Field Office, Agent Faraji. Did you have a nice time getting here? I hope so. I helped design the lobby." She resumes staring at the opposite wall.

>e
Faraji can't go that way.
