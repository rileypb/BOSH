Faraji is carrying:
  a green smartphone

>x me
Agent Faraji is dressed smartly in a black suit, with neat hair and a serious expression. Inside, they are a punk rocker, a fact that they are not shy about.

[Don't talk about me like I'm not here.]

>look at smartphone
It's a pretty nice phone, only a couple of years old, but Faraji doesn't have time to play with it. They need to get to the office.

>w
Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

>ask about the phone exchange
Faraji asks, "Tell me what's going on with the phones again?"

Margaret looks apologetic. "I'm sorry, I thought everyone knew. Budget cuts. They're trading in all our smart phones for cheaper models."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

>ask where klimp is
They ask, "Margaret, have you seen Klimp this morning?"

She shakes her head. "He hasn't been in yet."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask where Moira is.

>ask where moira is
They ask, "Has Moira come in yet?"

Margaret barely looks up from her work. "Nope."

Margaret says, "I should really take care of these boxes," and proceeds to flatten some.

A phone is ringing to the west.

Margaret goes west.

>w
Faraji forges further into the BOSH offices.

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. Faraji's door is open; Klimp's door and Moira's door are closed.

Margaret is here, carrying a couple of flattened boxes.

A phone is ringing to the south.

Margaret goes south.

>s
Faraji enters their new office full of... is it anticipation or dread?

Agent Faraji is in their office. They pause and survey the scene. It's not much -- four white walls, grey industrial carpet. Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

Margaret unlocks the BOSH back door.

Faraji can ask about the status of the computer.

>ask about the computer
"Margaret", they say, "what's up with my computer?"

"Oh, it got busted up during the move. I have it behind my desk -- you can see it if you want. We'll have to get you a new one."

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

Margaret opens the BOSH back door.

Margaret goes west.

>open desk
Faraji tries to open the desk to answer the phone, but it seems to be locked. They sigh. "Margaret must have the key."

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

>look at desk
The desk is a cheap DIY piece held together with hex screws. It has a single drawer which is closed.

Margaret arrives from the west.

That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Margaret closes the BOSH back door.

Margaret locks the BOSH back door.

Faraji can ask about the desk key.

>ask about desk key
They say, "Hey Margaret, do you know anything about my desk key?"

"Sure I do -- I put it in your desk." She furrows her brow. "What's the matter?"

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

Margaret goes north.

>open desk

They lack a key that fits their desk's drawer.

With trepidation, Faraji ventures once more into Margaret's domain.

Faraji can ask for the hex wrench or ask about the locked desk.

>ask for the hex wrench
They say, "Do you happen to have the hex wrench from putting together my desk?"

"Well, I did, but I dropped it down a heating vent behind my desk."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask about the locked desk.

>ask about the locked desk
They ask, "Margaret, do you know any way to get into my desk?"

"Hmm... take it apart?"

Looking tired, Margaret says, "Chief Klimp needs to get me an assistant. I can't do this all by myself."

Margaret looks at the boxes and says, "I should really take care of these." She takes a couple and flattens them.

Faraji steps out of the office into the parking lot.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Enter HELP for instructions.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

>n
Faraji trudges to the other end of the parking lot. It's much like where they left.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

>e
Faraji is greeted by a blast of music as they enter the store.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

"Good morning," Faraji says.
"Yeah," replies the clerk.

>look at case
In the glass case are a red screwdriver, a flashlight, a laptop computer and some wireless earbuds.

>look at screwdriver
A medium-length flat head screwdriver with a red plastic handle.

[I'm sure I won't need a screwdriver any time soon.]

>look at laptop
A knockoff of a fancy gaming laptop.

>look at flashlight
A small, sturdy flashlight.

The flashlight is currently switched off.

The clerk, looking at his phone, says, "I'm not supposed to be on my phone."

>ask clerk about clerk
"How're you doing?"

"No need to get personal, man."

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

As you enter the store, you catch a glimpse of a red screwdriver in the glass case under the counter.

The clerk paces back and forth behind the counter, muttering to himself.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask for a screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow?"

"Got one to buy, not one to borrow."

>buy screwdriver

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

[I've known public restrooms that had better ambience.]

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

Faraji gives the pawn shop owner a curt nod.
"Hey," Dave says.

The pawn shop door closes.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask for a screwdriver
They lean on the counter and ask, "Do you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow for a few minutes? I'm from the Bureau office next door."

The man shakes his head and says, "Sorry. I had one, but the guy who runs the laundromat borrowed it and didn't bring it back."

Faraji can ask about the laundromat owner.

>ask about the laundromat owner
They say, "How do you suppose I might get in touch with this man who runs the laundromat? I really could use a screwdriver."

"Well, that's a tricky one. Laundromat's been closed for almost two weeks now, since the owner just split for some reason he didn't bother to share. Not likely to get ahold of him. If you're not averse to a little trespassing, though, see if you come across a watch. Another thing he borrowed."

The sound of a car door slamming outside catches Faraji's attention.

Faraji can ask about the watch.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Looks like the Chief has already moved in.

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

[It's like a museum of bad taste.]

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

Chief Klimp barks, "What's with that ringing? Someone answer it!"

He turns to Faraji and grins. "Larch! Good to see you. What do you think of the new digs? I know, I know, it's a lousy office, I could barely fit all my stuff in here."

Faraji starts to answer, but Klimp interrupts. "Say, you read that new article in the Journal of Kinetic Experimentation on telekinesis? It's fascinating stuff. But seriously, can you do something about that phone, or do I have to ship you off to the Black Knight Satellite?" He chuckles and goes back to his work.

The Church of Scientology

The Church of Scientology is a multinational network and hierarchy of numerous ostensibly independent but interconnected corporate entities and other organizations devoted to the practice, administration, and dissemination of Scientology, a new religious movement. In reality, the Church of Scientology is a front for a global conspiracy to control the world.

Huffton Klimp, or simply "The Chief", who by his name and title should rightly be big and gruff, is a wiry guy with a thinning shock of red hair on top. Once the youngest and most devoted recruit in the Bureau, the years and his promotion to Bureau Head have not dulled his enthusiasm and idealism. He's a true believer in the existence of aliens, and he's convinced that the Bureau is the only thing standing between humanity and the alien menace. He's also convinced that the Bureau is the only thing standing between him and a comfortable retirement. He's a good guy, but he's a bit of a pain.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

"What do you mean?"

"I'm calling you now, but I haven't called you yet. I'm calling you from the future."

"Oh, I see. So you're calling me from the future to tell me that you're going to call me from the future."

"No, I'm calling you from the future to get you to try to answer the phone so that you'll end up meeting me so that I'll know to call you from the future. Don't worry about it, it's all timey-wimey. Aaanyway, now that you've answered -- thanks for rescuing Daniels. Also, we need your help with something. We need you to save the Dragon."

Larch Faraji will return in "BOSH II: The Dragon".
