Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

>ask about the phone exchange
Faraji asks, "Tell me what's going on with the phones again?"

Margaret looks apologetic. "I'm sorry, I thought everyone knew. Budget cuts. They're trading in all our smart phones for cheaper models."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

>ask where klimp is
They ask, "Margaret, have you seen Klimp this morning?"

She shakes her head. "He hasn't been in yet."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask where Moira is.

>ask where moira is
They ask, "Has Moira come in yet?"

Margaret barely looks up from her work. "Nope."

Margaret says, "I should really take care of these boxes," and proceeds to flatten some.

A phone is ringing to the west.

Margaret goes west.

>w
Faraji forges further into the BOSH offices.

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. Faraji's door is open; Klimp's door and Moira's door are closed.

Margaret is here, carrying a couple of flattened boxes.

A phone is ringing to the south.

Margaret goes south.

>s
Faraji enters their new office full of... is it anticipation or dread?

Agent Faraji is in their office. They pause and survey the scene. It's not much -- four white walls, grey industrial carpet. Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

Margaret unlocks the BOSH back door.

Faraji can ask about the status of the computer.

>ask about computer
"Margaret", they say, "what's up with my computer?"

"Oh, it got busted up during the move. I have it behind my desk -- you can see it if you want. We'll have to get you a new one."

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

Margaret opens the BOSH back door.

Margaret goes west.

>open desk
Faraji tries to open the desk to answer the phone, but it seems to be locked. They sigh. "Margaret must have the key."

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

>look at desk
The desk is a cheap DIY piece held together with hex screws. It has a single drawer which is closed.

A phone is ringing inside Faraji's desk.

Margaret arrives from the west.

>open drawer
(first unlocking Faraji's desk's drawer)
They lack a key that fits their desk's drawer.

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

Margaret closes the BOSH back door.

Margaret locks the BOSH back door.

>ask margaret about margaret
"How are you doing, Margaret?"

"I'm great!" Margaret says. "So many things to unpack!"

A phone is ringing inside Faraji's desk.

Margaret goes north.

>n
Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. Faraji's door is open; Klimp's door and Moira's door are closed.

Also here is Margaret.

A phone is ringing to the south, in Faraji's office.

Margaret goes east.

>e
With trepidation, Faraji ventures once more into Margaret's domain.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm.

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask about the desk key.

>ask about the desk key
They say, "Hey Margaret, do you know anything about my desk key?"

"Sure I do -- I put it in your desk." She furrows her brow. "What's the matter?"

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask for the hex wrench or ask about the locked desk.

>ask about the locked dexk
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask for the hex wrench or ask about the locked desk.

>ask about the locked desk
They ask, "Margaret, do you know any way to get into my desk?"

"Hmm... take it apart?"

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask for the hex wrench.

>ask for the hex wrench
They say, "Do you happen to have the hex wrench from putting together my desk?"

"Well, I did, but I dropped it down a heating vent behind my desk."

A phone is ringing to the west.

>look behind desk
There are a number of shelves of office supplies behind the desk. There is also a heating vent on the floor here.

Faraji finds their computer and pulls it out.

A phone is ringing to the west.

>look at computer
Faraji's computer has been damaged beyond repair. But they do find a thumb drive and take it.

Margaret looks at her phone. "I can't believe they're taking away our smart phones. I don't know how I'm going to keep in touch with my friends."

A phone is ringing to the west.

>take thumb drive
Faraji already has that.

A phone is ringing to the west.

>i
Faraji is carrying:
  a thumb drive

Margaret looks around, then whispers, "I don't think the Chief likes me. He's always so grumpy."

Margaret takes a box and starts to flatten it.

A phone is ringing to the west.

Margaret goes west.

>look at heating vent
A typical air register with a grill which one would hope would stop things like, say, a hex wrench from falling through. It's set in the floor behind the front desk. The vent is held closed by four screws.

In the heating vent is a hex wrench.

A phone is ringing to the west.

>look at screws
Four plain flat head screws.

[Flathead screws. A favorite of Dimwits.]

A phone is ringing to the west.

>e
Faraji steps out of the office into the parking lot.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Enter HELP for instructions.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

>sw
(first opening the pawn shop door)
"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

[I've known public restrooms that had better ambience.]

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

Faraji gives the pawn shop owner a curt nod.
"Hey," Dave says.

The pawn shop door closes.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask for a screwdriver
They lean on the counter and ask, "Do you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow for a few minutes? I'm from the Bureau office next door."

The man shakes his head and says, "Sorry. I had one, but the guy who runs the laundromat borrowed it and didn't bring it back."

Faraji can ask about the laundromat owner.

>ask about the laundromat owner
They say, "How do you suppose I might get in touch with this man who runs the laundromat? I really could use a screwdriver."

"Well, that's a tricky one. Laundromat's been closed for almost two weeks now, since the owner just split for some reason he didn't bother to share. Not likely to get ahold of him. If you're not averse to a little trespassing, though, see if you come across a watch. Another thing he borrowed."

The sound of a car door slamming outside catches Faraji's attention.

Faraji can ask about the watch.

>ask about the watch
They ask, "What's so special about this watch?"

"It's a family heirloom. I'd like to get it back."

>ne
(first opening the pawn shop door)
Once again -- "Cha-ching!" -- as Faraji leaves the store.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Enter HELP for instructions.

Klimp's Porsche takes up two spots.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

The pawn shop door closes.

>look at porsche

Klimp drives a sleek 2017 Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet.

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask for a screwdriver
They ask, "Margaret, where's the screwdriver?"

"Umm... I think it was in a box we had to leave behind." Margaret looks embarrassed. "What? I never thought we'd need it. This isn't a construction site after all. Maybe if Klimp had paid for the bigger UHaul..." She stares past Faraji awkwardly.

A phone is ringing to the west.

>w
Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. Moira's door is closed; Faraji's door and Klimp's door are open.

A phone is ringing to the south, in their office.

>w
Faraji takes a deep breath and enters the office of the Chief of BOSH.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Looks like the Chief has already moved in.

Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

[It's like a museum of bad taste.]

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

Chief Klimp barks, "What's with that ringing? Someone answer it!"

He turns to Faraji and grins. "Larch! Good to see you. What do you think of the new digs? I know, I know, it's a lousy office, I could barely fit all my stuff in here."

Faraji starts to answer, but Klimp interrupts. "Say, you read that new article in the Journal of Kinetic Experimentation on telekinesis? It's fascinating stuff. But seriously, can you do something about that phone, or do I have to ship you off to the Black Knight Satellite?" He chuckles and goes back to his work.

A phone is ringing to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask for a screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a --"

"Screwdriver you could borrow? No, no, someone stole my screwdriver collection. Probably the Illuminati."

A phone is ringing to the east.

>ask about the illuminati
Faraji begins, "You believe in the --"

"Illuminati? Of course. They're everywhere. They're in the government, in the media, in the music industry. They're in the Bureau. They're in the BOSH offices. They're in the White House. They're in the Vatican. They're in the Black Knight Satellite." Klimp looks around. "They're in this room... okay, maybe not this room. And hopefully not in the BOSH offices. But they're everywhere else. You don't think Margaret's Illuminati, do you?"

A phone is ringing to the east.

>ask about the black knight satellite
"Chief, is the Black Knight Satellite --"

"Real? Yes, it's real. I mean, it's not a satellite, but it's real. You ever hear of the Tunguska Event? There's a connection, you know."

A phone is ringing to the east.

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

Klimp taps his fingers on the desk and says, "Did I ever tell you about my friend Doris? We went a lot of places together back when the Bureau was just starting out. He's a good guy. A bit of a liar, but a good guy."

A phone is ringing to the east.

>look at desk
(the Chief's desk)
This desk is a beautiful assembly of smokey glass and chrome framing. The "legs" form shelves where Klimp keeps yet more curios. One might wonder where Klimp gets the money.

[Most of us just want a surface to keep our stuff off the floor.]

A phone is ringing to the east.

>look at legs
On the desk shelves is a polished orange marble dodecahedron.

Klimp looks out the window and says, "I was just thinking about the future of the Bureau. Savra's going to ruin everything. I have a feeling he's not quite human."

A phone is ringing to the east.

>look at dodecahedron
A relic of the Chief's sacred geometry phase.

[I'm partial to the pentagonal hexecontahedron, actually.]

A phone is ringing to the east.

Faraji can ask to borrow the dodecahedron.

>ask to borrow the dodecahedron
They ask, "Chief, mind if I borrow the dodecahedron?"

He thinks for a moment. "Actually, I need it to keep my computer running properly. It's a long story."

A phone is ringing to the east.

Faraji breathes easier as they leave the office of the Chief of BOSH.

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. Moira's door is closed; Faraji's door and Klimp's door are open.

Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair.

North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

Faraji is greeted by a blast of music as they enter the store.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

As you enter the store, you catch a glimpse of a red screwdriver in the glass case under the counter.

"Good morning," Faraji says.
"Yeah," replies the clerk.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask for a screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow?"

"Got one to buy, not one to borrow."

Faraji walks back to the south end of the parking lot.

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Klimp's Porsche takes up two spots.

Faraji peers through the windows of the laundromat at the rows of aging machines. A sign on the door says "Closed for renovations". They turn away, unimpressed.

>look at front door
It's a typical glass door. Taped to it is a sign that says "Closed for renovations".

(first opening the pawn shop door)
Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

The pawn shop door closes.

That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Dave looks at the ceiling. "You know, I've been thinking about getting another tattoo. I think this one will be Snorlax."

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly.

The Dictionary of Strangeness is a compendium of the weird and wonderful, from the Abominable Snowman to Zener Cards. Flipping through it, Faraji comes upon an entry:

The Voynich Manuscript

The Voynich manuscript is an illustrated codex hand-written in an unknown writing system. The vellum on which it is written has been carbon-dated to the early 15th century, and may have been composed in Northern Italy during the Italian Renaissance. The manuscript is named after Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish-Samogitian book dealer who purchased it in 1912. Some of the pages are missing, with around 240 remaining. The text is written from left to right, and most of the pages have illustrations or diagrams. The Voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur cryptographers, including American and British codebreakers from both World War I and World War II. No one has yet succeeded in deciphering the text, and it has become a famous case in the history of cryptography.

Chief Klimp says "If you want to know more about anything in there, just ask me."

The Chupacabra

The Chupacabra is a legendary creature in the folklore of parts of the Americas, with its first sightings reported in Puerto Rico. The name comes from the animal's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats.

Ancient astronauts

Ancient astronauts is the idea that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity and prehistoric times. Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of human cultures, technologies, and religions. The idea has been popularized by authors such as Erich von Dniken, who wrote the 1968 book Chariots of the Gods?, and has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries, and films.
