Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."

"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."

Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

>ask maragaret about phone
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>ask about phone
Faraji asks, "Tell me what's going on with the phones again?"

Margaret looks apologetic. "I'm sorry, I thought everyone knew. Budget cuts. They're trading in all our smart phones for cheaper models."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

Faraji is carrying nothing.

While unpacking a box of office supplies, Margaret says, "I can't believe how much stuff we have. I don't know where to put it all."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.

>ask who klimp is
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

They ask, "Margaret, have you seen Klimp this morning?"

She shakes her head. "He hasn't been in yet."

A phone is ringing to the west.

Faraji can ask where Moira is.

>ask where moira is
They ask, "Has Moira come in yet?"

Margaret barely looks up from her work. "Nope."

Margaret sighs and says, "So many boxes..." She picks up some and flattens them.

A phone is ringing to the west.

Margaret goes west.

Faraji forges further into the BOSH offices.

One can hear the sound of boxes being flattened in the front office.

A phone is ringing to the south.

Margaret arrives from the east, carrying a couple of flattened boxes.

>s
Faraji enters their new office full of... is it anticipation or dread?

Agent Faraji is in their office. They pause and survey the scene. It's not much -- four white walls, grey industrial carpet. Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

Margaret arrives from the north, carrying a couple of flattened boxes.

That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Suddenly Agent Faraji is surrounded by a white vapor. When it clears, they find themself somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is in the Bureau of Special Help. It is bare save for a bookshelf and a button on the wall marked "Exit". Faraji can go east or north from here.

You can type EXAMINE BOOKSHELF to see what's on the shelf, or PUSH BUTTON to leave help. You can also type a direction (like EAST) to move around. Type LOOK to repeat the description of the room.

>examine bookshelf
The shelf is full of books, each with a title that seems to promise help with some problem or other. Faraji may READ any of them to get some help.

On the Help Shelf are IF Basics, Commands Volume 1, Commands Volume 2, Commands Volume 3, Strategies of Adventuring, Grammar of IF and BOSH Game Book.

>read bosh game book
The game you are playing is "Bureau of Strange Happenings", or BOSH for short. It is a text adventure game, a type of game where you interact with a world made of text. In BOSH, you play the role of Agent Faraji, a detective investigating strange occurrences in the United States and its territories. As Agent Faraji, you will travel to different locations, talk to characters, and solve puzzles to uncover the truth behind these strange happenings.

Some notes specific to BOSH:

1. The HINTS command will give you a list of available hint topics. You can then type HINT followed by the topic you want a hint on. Note that the available hints will change depending on where you are in the game. The HINTS command will bold-face the topics that have new hints available.

2. You will automatically talk to characters when you enter a room with them. You can type ASK character ABOUT topic to ask a character about a particular topic. Note that not all characters will respond to all topics. The characters do tend to know about things in their immediate vicinity and within their areas of expertise.

3. There are also a lot of books in the game, many of which are readable.

>*Am I spelling Margaret's name right? It seems like "Ask Margaret about TOPIC" doesn't work as well as "Ask about TOPIC" 
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

Agent Faraji is in the Observation Room. This small white room seems like a museum gallery, but with a window instead of art. Through the window you can see a lake at night, pelted by rain. Nothing can be seen through the storm-darkened waters.

A comfortable-looking viewing couch dominates the center of the observation room. Exits lead north and west.

You can type LOOK to repeat the description of the room. You can also EXAMINE an object to get a closer look at it. Or you can SIT ON THE COUCH. See what happens if you try to TAKE an object in the window.

Someone has left an umbrella on the couch.

Agent Faraji is in the ornamental garden. Flowers and shrubs crowd the paths. Faraji can leave to the south. A door leads west.

Sometimes things you need will be hidden. You can type EXAMINE FLOWERS to see if there's anything there.

Faraji notices a glint of metal among the flowers. It's a small brass key. They take it.

Apparently the bureau did make off with at least one piece of government furniture. A bland, institutional piece with fake leather seats, it's at least preferable to second-hand upholstery.

Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke.

>look at photos
The photo of Ezra Gaunt and Petula Goldberg smiling together is particularly poignant, as they were just let go last month.

[Klimp, Ezra, Petula, and I used to go out for drinks at the Cock and Bull in downtown DC. Good times.]

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. Faraji's door is open; Klimp's door and Moira's door are closed.

Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair. In lieu of windows, there are a few things on the wall: their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake, and a photo of their soccer team. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

A phone is ringing inside their desk.

>look at screws
Several hex screws hold the desk drawer together.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm.

Margaret looks at the coffee table. "I can't believe they charged us $8 for that. It's not even real wood."

Margaret takes a box and starts to flatten it.
