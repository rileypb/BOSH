As an agent of the Bureau of Strange Happenings (BOSH), it is Agent Larch Faraji's job to investigate unexplained phenomena throughout the United States and its territories. Recently, however, business hasn't been good. Once a bustling office with a dozen Agents, the Bureau's been reduced to just three: Faraji, Moira Zin, and Chief Huffton Klimp. The Bureau's expansive and well-appointed office suite was taken over by the State Department Book Club, and now the agents are consigned to a tiny suite in a strip mall in the remote D.C. suburb of Swamp Park, Maryland. Today is move-in day at the bureau.
 
We open on a decrepit strip mall just as an aging Hyundai pulls into the potholed parking lot. Agent Faraji steps out of the car. They survey the area and wrinkle their nose.

The Bureau of Strange Happenings
An Interactive Phenomenon by Phil Riley
Release 1 / Serial number 240521 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD
 
Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.
 
>i
Faraji is carrying:
  a green smartphone
 
>look me
Agent Faraji is dressed smartly in a black suit, with neat hair and a serious expression. Inside, they are a punk rocker, a fact that they are not shy about.
 
[Don't talk about me like I'm not here.]
 
>look smartphone
It's a pretty nice phone, only a couple of years old, but Faraji doesn't have time to play with it. They need to get to the office.
 
>w
Just like in the store this once was, the door chimes as Faraji walks in.
 
Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.
 
The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.
 
The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm, unpacking boxes and assembling an approximation of a respectable front office, all as if the Bureau isn't going to be shut down before the year is out. She sees Faraji and practically squeals. "Agent Faraji! I'm sorry -- Larch! How are you? I hope you don't mind -- I took the liberty of putting your desk together. I just love hex wrenches, don't you? Also, your new phone is here. I put it in your desk. Now I just need you to give me your old phone so I can deactivate it."
 
"Oh, good", Faraji says. "Our phone downgrades have arrived from our bureaucratic betters."
 
Faraji hands Margaret their old phone. Margaret taps a few keys on her computer and says "There! All settled."
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.
 
>ask about the phone exchange
Faraji asks, "Tell me what's going on with the phones again?"
 
Margaret looks apologetic. "I'm sorry, I thought everyone knew. Budget cuts. They're trading in all our smart phones for cheaper models."
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
Faraji can ask where Klimp is or ask where Moira is.
 
>ask where klimp is
They ask, "Margaret, have you seen Klimp this morning?"
 
She shakes her head. "He hasn't been in yet."
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
Faraji can ask where Moira is.
 
>ask where moira is
They ask, "Has Moira come in yet?"
 
Margaret barely looks up from her work. "Nope."
 
Margaret says, "I should really take care of these boxes," and proceeds to flatten some.
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
Margaret goes west.
 
>w
Faraji forges further into the BOSH offices.
 
Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. Faraji's door is open; Klimp's door and Moira's door are closed.
 
Margaret is here, carrying a couple of flattened boxes.
 
A phone is ringing to the south.
 
Margaret goes south.
 
>s
Faraji enters their new office full of... is it anticipation or dread?
 
Agent Faraji is in their office. They pause and survey the scene. It's not much -- four white walls, grey industrial carpet. Margaret has helpfully assembled Faraji's desk and chair, though how sturdily is an open question. She also took the time to put up some of Agent Faraji's office decor -- their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, an original pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake by semi-acclaimed Washington DC artist Darius 5200, and a photo of their soccer team. At the very least the wall coverings help compensate for the lack of windows. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.
 
Faraji mutters, "Where's my computer?"
 
A phone is ringing inside their desk.
 
Margaret unlocks the BOSH back door.
 
Faraji can ask about the status of the computer.
 
>ask about the computer
"Margaret", they say, "what's up with my computer?"
 
"Oh, it got busted up during the move. I have it behind my desk -- you can see it if you want. We'll have to get you a new one."
 
A phone is ringing inside their desk.
 
Margaret opens the BOSH back door.
 
Margaret goes west.
 
>w
The scent of asphalt and old cigarette butts greets Faraji as they leave the office.
 
Agent Faraji is in the back lot. This is a small area of asphalt between the building and a chain link fence looking in on an industrial property. A door to east leads into the BOSH offices, and one to the north enters the laundromat. There is a blue dumpster here.
 
Margaret is here, carrying a couple of flattened boxes.
 
A phone is ringing to the east, in their office.
 
Margaret tosses the flattened boxes over the edge of the dumpster.
 
>ask margaret about desk
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.
 
A phone is ringing to the east, in Faraji's office.
 
Margaret goes east.

Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair. In lieu of windows, there are a few things on the wall: their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake, and a photo of their soccer team. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.
 
Also here is Margaret.
 
A phone is ringing inside Faraji's desk.
 
Margaret closes the BOSH back door.
 
Margaret locks the BOSH back door.
 
>open desk
Faraji tries to open the desk to answer the phone, but it seems to be locked. They sigh. "Margaret must have the key."
 
A phone is ringing inside their desk.
 
Margaret goes north.

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. Faraji's door is open; Klimp's door and Moira's door are closed.
 
Also here is Margaret.
 
A phone is ringing to the south, in Faraji's office.
 
Margaret goes east.
 
>e
With trepidation, Faraji ventures once more into Margaret's domain.
 
Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.
 
The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.
 
The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm.
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
Faraji can ask about the desk key.
 
>ask about the desk key
They say, "Hey Margaret, do you know anything about my desk key?"
 
"Sure I do -- I put it in your desk." She furrows her brow. "What's the matter?"
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
Faraji can ask about the locked desk.
 
>ask about the locked desk
They ask, "Margaret, do you know any way to get into my desk?"
 
"Hmm... take it apart?"
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
>ask margaret about wrench
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.
 
Margaret pulls a box of staples out of a box. "I don't know why we have so many staples. We never use them."
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
>commands
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.
 
>look at desk
The former sales counter now functions as a desk for the office manager (currently Margaret). Behind it are a number of shelves holding office supplies.
 
Margaret takes a box and starts to flatten it.
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
Margaret goes west.
 
>x shelves
Pens, paper, nothing Faraji's really concerned with now.
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
>*It feels like the description "behind it are a number of shelves" might be a miscue - the reason why I didn't look behind he desk on earlier playthroughs
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.
 
>*maybe something like "next to it are some shelves holding office supplies" would make it clearer that the player isn't seeing behind the desk (or the vent there)
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.
 
>look behind desk
There are a number of shelves of office supplies behind the desk. There is also a heating vent on the floor here.
 
Faraji finds their computer and pulls it out.

Faraji's computer is too unwieldy to carry around.
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
>look at computer
Faraji's computer has been damaged beyond repair. But they do find a thumb drive and take it.
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
>look at thumb drive
It's a red plastic thumb drive, with what look like symbols scratched on the surface, but they're like no symbols you've ever seen. The metal USB end is somewhat corroded.
 
[Some crazy dude mailed this to me last month, said he found it in an ancient Onandaga root cellar on a farm in upstate New York. Claimed it was proof of time travel.]
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
Margaret arrives from the west.
 
>look at symbols
The symbols on the thumb drive look like some kind of language, but none Faraji recognizes.
 
[These kids today and their conlangs.]
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
>look at vent
A typical air register with a grill which one would hope would stop things like, say, a hex wrench from falling through. It's set in the floor behind the front desk. The vent is held closed by four screws.
 
In the heating vent is a hex wrench.
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.
 
>ask for a screwdriver
They ask, "Margaret, where's the screwdriver?"
 
"Umm... I think it was in a box we had to leave behind." Margaret looks embarrassed. "What? I never thought we'd need it. This isn't a construction site after all. Maybe if Klimp had paid for the bigger UHaul..." She stares past Faraji awkwardly.
 
A phone is ringing to the west.
 
>e
Faraji steps out of the office into the parking lot.
 
Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

"Cha-ching!" rings the electronic chime as Faraji steps into the store.
 
Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.
 
The exit is northeast.
 
[I've known public restrooms that had better ambience.]
 
A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.
 
Faraji gives the pawn shop owner a curt nod.
"Hey," Dave says.
 
The pawn shop door closes.
 
Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

They lean on the counter and ask, "Do you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow for a few minutes? I'm from the Bureau office next door."
 
The man shakes his head and says, "Sorry. I had one, but the guy who runs the laundromat borrowed it and didn't bring it back."
 
Faraji can ask about the laundromat owner.
 
>ask about the laundromat owner
They say, "How do you suppose I might get in touch with this man who runs the laundromat? I really could use a screwdriver."
 
"Well, that's a tricky one. Laundromat's been closed for almost two weeks now, since the owner just split for some reason he didn't bother to share. Not likely to get ahold of him. If you're not averse to a little trespassing, though, see if you come across a watch. Another thing he borrowed."
 
The sound of a car door slamming outside catches Faraji's attention.
 
Faraji can ask about the watch.

They ask, "What's so special about this watch?"
 
"It's a family heirloom. I'd like to get it back."

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.
 
Chief Klimp barks, "What's with that ringing? Someone answer it!"
 
He turns to Faraji and grins. "Larch! Good to see you. What do you think of the new digs? I know, I know, it's a lousy office, I could barely fit all my stuff in here."
 
Faraji starts to answer, but Klimp interrupts. "Say, you read that new article in the Journal of Kinetic Experimentation on telekinesis? It's fascinating stuff. But seriously, can you do something about that phone, or do I have to ship you off to the Black Knight Satellite?" He chuckles and goes back to his work.

The Chief's library boasts many interesting titles, from Alton Cherry's Waiting for the Aliens to Debi Bosworth's My Travels in Time. For the uninitiated, there is also a copy of The Dictionary of Strangeness.

The counter is arrayed with displays of jewelry, watches, and the like.

(first opening the pawn shop door)
Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash. To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm.

Also here is Faraji's computer.

Margaret grimaces. "I went over to look at the pawn shop, and the guy tried to hit on me. I told him I was married, but he didn't care. Do you think I'm bad for lying?"

Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair. In lieu of windows, there are a few things on the wall: their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake, and a photo of their soccer team. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter serves as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coatrack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

Hyperspace is a four-dimensional plane of being overlaying our own three-dimensional plane. The familiar directions (north, south, up, northeast, etc.) work there, as do two new directions "back" and "forth", and their combinations with our compass directions: forthnorth, backeast, etc. These can be abbreviated just as compass directions can: b, f, fn, be, and so on.

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

Faraji descends the stairs and discovers... an office?

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

[I bet they don't get much foot traffic here.]

A young woman is sitting at the desk. Apparently doing nothing, she looks up from her desk and smiles at Faraji. "Hello, I'm Maggie," she says. "Welcome to the BOSH Hyperspace Field Office, Agent Faraji. Did you have a nice time getting here? I hope so. I helped design the lobby." She resumes staring at the opposite wall.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

"Who are you?"

"I'm Maggie. I'm the receptionist here at the BOSH Hyperspace Field Office. I'm here to help you with whatever you need, as long as it's not touching the control panel."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

"It's a control panel. It controls things. You're not allowed to touch it."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

The desk -- white, polished, and gleaming -- is empty except for a small control panel.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

Maggie seems a little vacant. She's staring at nothing in particular.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

"What does any of this have to do with me?"

"Ask Doris. Or don't. Something confusing is going on, and you're in the middle of it. Or maybe you're not. Who can say?"

>ask maggie about doris
"Who is Doris?"

"Doris is the field office chief," Maggie says dreamily. "He's a riddle, wrapped in bacon, inside an egg. You can find him in his office, west of here."

>*I recall Klimp mentioning Doris
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

Faraji leaves Maggie's relentless stare behind.

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north, south, east, west, forth, and back.

Faraji enters the domain of the chief of the field office.

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

"Ah, Larch," Doris exclaims, standing up to shake their hand. "I've been waiting for you to pay us a visit. Did you bring the thumb drive?"

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask for a screwdriver
They ask, "Do you have a screwdriver?"

"No, I don't have a screwdriver. Sonic or otherwise."

Faraji can ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask who he is
They ask "Who are you?"

He looks taken aback for a moment, then recovers his composure. "Ah yes, introductions. I'm Doris, chief of the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau."

Faraji can ask about his name, ask where we are, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask where we are
Faraji looks around and asks, "Where are we? What is this place?"

Doris answers, "You're in the hyperspatial field office of the Bureau of Strange Happenings. But I guess that doesn't exactly clear things up for you. Practically, your office is a branch of ours, but since you have the official recognition of the US government -- for now -- you get the glory. Besides, due to the nature of our work, we prefer to remain underground, so to speak. How's Klimp, by the way? Ah, we had some good times. But you know what they say -- what happens in Pompeii, stays in Pompeii.

Faraji can ask about his name, ask how to get home, tell Doris Klimp is fine or show him the thumb drive.

>*asking about his name seems kind of rude, so I hope it's not important to the plot
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>tell doris klimp is fine
They say, "He's just fine."

"Great! Be sure to say hi for me."

Faraji can ask about his name, ask how to get home or show him the thumb drive.

>ask how to get home
They ask, "Just how can I get home from here?"

"Go ask Maggie; she can help you."

Faraji can ask about his name or show him the thumb drive.

>e
Faraji couldn't be happier to get away from Doris's incessant chatter.

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north, south, east, west, forth, and back.

>e
Faraji uneasily steps back into Maggie's domain.

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

Maggie is sitting at the desk, doing nothing Faraji can discern.

Faraji can ask how to get home.

>*was there a similar message about getting away from Klimp's chatter?
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>ask maggie how to get home
They ask, "How can I get home from here?"

Maggie looks up from her computer. "Oh, you're ready to go? I'll activate the auxiliary portal for you" She types rapidly on her computer, then says "It's all ready -- go west down the hallway and turn to the back into Portal Room 2."

Faraji can ask about his name or show him the thumb drive.

>show him the thumb drive
They answer, "Yes, I have it."

"Fantastic! Hand it here."

Faraji can ask about his name or hand over the thumb drive.

>hand over the thumb drive
They give the thumb drive to Doris.

"Great, great." He peruses the drive. "We lost one of our New York agents -- a guy named Daniels -- to a slingshot effect that threw him far back in time. We're always monitoring for artifacts that are out of place or anachronistic to lead us to lost agents.

He continues, "The scratch marks here say, 'They found me out and sent me back. 14th century. Old Onandaga holy place. Savra is going to move on the Dragon.'"

Faraji can ask about his name, ask about Savra, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>ask doris about daniels
"Who is Daniels, anyway?"

"He's a field agent. This is his first mission since the unfortunate incident in Budapest."

Faraji can ask about his name, ask about Savra, ask about the Dragon or ask about time travel.

>ask about the dragon
They say, "Who is this 'Dragon'?"

Doris brings his finger to his lips. "Classified. Need to know only. But we should be talking about the mission instead."

Faraji can ask about his name, ask about Savra, ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

Faraji can ask about his name, ask about Savra, ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Faraji can ask about his name, ask about Savra, ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

>ask about savra
"Senator Savra? What does he have to with anything?" Faraji asks.

Doris says, "Tell me, Agent. Do you believe in aliens? That alien species have visited this planet?"

Faraji can ask about his name, tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation, tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation, ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

>*Seems weird to talk about "this planet" when we're in hyperspace. Are we still on earth?
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>tell doris they do believe in alien visitation
"Yes. The evidence is overwhelming," says Faraji.

Doris laughs. "Nonsense, all of it. Get it out of your head. The whole idea is ridiculous. Senator Savra is not an alien." he looks at Faraji significiantly.

They look at them unbelievingly. "What are you talking about?"

Doris shakes his head. "I thought you would know. He's a member of a race of Earth beings more ancient than our own. Agent Faraji, Senator Savra is a lizard man."

Faraji can ask about his name, ask what is a lizard man, ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

>ask what is a lizard man
They look incredulous. "And just what is a lizard man?"

"Just what it sounds like. It's a bipedal, intelligent reptilian creature."

Faraji can ask about his name, Savra's not reptilian, ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

>savra's not reptilian
"But Savra isn't a reptile!"

"He's in disguise! Whatever, it doesn't matter. What matters is your mission."

Faraji can ask about his name, ask about the mission or ask about time travel.

>ask about the mission
They say, "What's the mission?"

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at an Onandaga holy place in the 14th century. Now we need to find out where that is. Fortunately, there's a book that can help. Unfortunately, I don't have it. Fortunately, you're here to go find it. Unfortunately, the name's gotten a bit jumbled in my head. I think it was something like New Bikers of Troy. Or something. I'm bad with things like titles and letters and keeping things the right way 'round. But you'll find it. I know you will. Come back here when you have."

Faraji can ask about his name or ask about time travel.

>ask about time travel
Disbelievingly, Faraji asks, "Time travel? For real?"

"Yes, yes," Doris responds. "Don't get too worked up over it. It gets old fast."

Faraji can ask about his name.

>*that's an entertaining response
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north, south, east, west, forth, and back.

Faraji takes a strange turn into a room labeled "Portal Room 2".

Agent Faraji is in Portal Room 2. The room is full of humming, glowing machinery, all of it attached to a large, arch-shaped portal in the middle of the room. A sign on the portal says "Auxiliary Portal". The exit is forth.

After a few seconds, someone inserts a key in the lock and opens the door. It's Faraji's colleague Moira Zin. "How'd you get in there, Larch?"

You exit the closet.

Agent Faraji is in Moira's office. It is, like Moira herself, neat and orderly. She's clearly made the most of the meager funds she had for furnishing her office. Behind a modest yet functional desk is a modest yet functional office chair. Her bookshelves are filled with titles relating to investigative techniques, law, and skepticism. In the east wall is a closet door. The exit is to the south.

Moira Zin is here, arranging her new office.

A phone is ringing to the south.

Wearing the astral lenses in fluorescent light is blinding. They quickly remove the glasses.

Faraji can tell Moira Zin about the hyperdimensional portal or ask for a screwdriver.

>*relieved I though of that
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Agent Faraji is at the top of a descending stair. It is made of the same gossamer, questionably real stuff as the ground, the pillar, and the readouts. Faraji can't see past the first turn of the stairs, unfortunately.

On the readout of the mystic compass floats a set of ethereal symbols: o : o : o

The town of Enigma Lake was flooded when the reservoir was created, and that's where the intersection is!" Doris concludes with a look of satisfaction.

"So..." Faraji says.

"So. I'm sending you back to 1954, right before the flooding of Enigma Lake, and you'll find whatever Daniels left for us to find. Maybe we can stage a rescue. Why 1954? I'd rather not risk a longer temporal jaunt before we know what we're dealing with."

Faraji can ask about his name or tell Doris they're ready to go.

The portal, made of the same astral stuff this whole dimension is made of, looms over the rest of the room. Inside it is a shimmering curtain of light, leading to another time and place. On the right post is a control panel. A label on the top of the arch reads "Portal to the Past."

>*now the aside in Portal Room 2 makes sense
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>look at control panel
A control panel is attached to the portal. It has an LED display and a keypad. The display reads "62358234". A large red button underneath says "RESET".

>enter portal
Faraji enters the field of light, and they are suddenly somewhere else.

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding. A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

[Time travel should be accompanied by more fanfare.]

Also here is a backpack (empty and open).

Faraji pushes through the back door into the cool night.

The drizzle falls steadily, chilling the air.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. It's probably beautiful during the day, but tonight the deep shadows among the trees seem ominous. They are watchful and tense as they explore the park.

The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by stone walls.

>look at obelisk
Its faux Egyptian design is incongruous adjacent to the adamantly traditional town hall. Faraji can just make out a small crystal adornment rising from the top.

[I don't know what it is, but obelisks always seem to be bad news.]

The drizzle stops, at least for now.

>look at adornment
From what Faraji can make out, it's a clear crystal held aloft by some kind of metal fitting.

The sky is overcast.

>climb obelisk
The obelisk offers no handholds adequate for climbing.

Faraji leaves the shadows of the park for the town hall.

Agent Faraji is walking on Lake Street by the gym. Lake Street runs north and south from here. To the east is the public gymnasium, while to the west is the town hall, which is not enterable from here.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "You are too late to stop us. We will have the Dragon!"

>'sup?
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>talk to lizard men
Faraji is already talking to the group of lizard people.

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

The world turns inside out, and suddenly Faraji is somewhere else.

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

Doris looks up from his desk. "There are things you don't know, Larch. Things that no one knows. Well, except me."

Faraji can ask about his name.

A standard electrical outlet is set into the wall. To the east is the vestry. You can also take a ladder up to the steeple, or stairs down to the basement. The exit is to the west.

Also here is a table lamp (missing a bulb and plugged into the electrical outlet).

>put bulb in lamp
Faraji puts the light bulb into the standard socket.

>turn on lamp
That's already on.

>turn off lamp
Faraji switches the table lamp off.

The table lamp is now unlit.

The rain falls steadily, soaking the ground.

Agent Faraji is walking on Lake Street by the park. Lake Street runs north and south from here. To the west is the park, while to the east is the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake.

Agent Faraji is walking on Lake Street by the gym. Lake Street runs north and south from here. To the east is the public gymnasium, while to the west is the town hall, which is not enterable from here.

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Main and Lake. Main goes west, while Lake runs north. The corner of the town hall is to the northwest, although it cannot be entered there. Southeast is the entrance to WGXC "Galaxy" Radio. There is a broadcast tower on top of the building.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the west, on the corner of Main and Solvay.

To the west, the shadowy figures move out of view to the north.

The drizzle falls steadily, soaking the ground.

>e
That way ends in a residential building. The street leads north and west.

The drizzle stops, at least for now.

>se
Faraji enters the radio station, which is oddly quiet.

Agent Faraji is in Radio Station WGXC. This is the town radio station. South is the entrance to the broadcast booth. A staircase runs upwards, presumably to the roof and the broadcast antenna. The exit is northwest.

Wearing the astral lenses in fluorescent light is blinding. They quickly remove the glasses.

>s
Faraji can't go that way.

>n
Faraji can't go that way.

>look at broadcast booth
The broadcast booth, visible through a window, is a small room with a microphone and a soundboard.

>look at microphone
There's nothing like that nearby.

>look at soundboard
There's nothing like that nearby.

>up
Faraji climbs the stairs to the roof.

The clouds obscure the moon.

Agent Faraji is on the radio station roof. They can see the obelisk in the park clearly from here. The broadcast tower rises many feet above them. The exit is down. A metal cabinet is attached to the foot of the tower, held shut by a padlock.

>look at obelisk
The obelisk in the park is clearly visible from here. 

The sky is overcast.

>open cabinet

Faraji lacks a key that fits the metal cabinet.

The clouds obscure the stars.

Agent Faraji is on 200 block of Main Street. The street runs east and west from here. South is the edifice of Rolle's Department Store. North is the town hall.

>w
Faraji treads the eerily quiet street westward, encountering a clump of shops.

Agent Faraji is on the corner of Main and Solvay. Main Street runs east from here, while Solvay Road heads north. South of here, Henry's Hot Skillet promises all of the comforts of the mid-twentieth-century diner. A bookstore named The Reading Room lies to the west, while Fresnel's Music is southwest.

>sw
Needing a little culture, Faraji heads into the music store.

Agent Faraji is in Fresnel's Music. The music store, like most of the town, is empty of all but a few items of little value. The exit is to the northeast.

[It's like John Cage's 4'33" in store form.]

A tuning fork lies on the counter.

>take tuning fork
Taken.

>ne
Faraji leaves the music store.

The sky is void of stars tonight.

>w
Faraji, hankering for a good book, heads into the bookstore.

Agent Faraji is in the Reading Room. The reading room is a small, cozy space, with a number of comfortable chairs and a few tables. A sales counter is at the back of the room. Bookshelves lead back into the depths of the store. A narrow staircase leads down and the front door is east.

[Look, I'd really love to sit down and read a book, but I've got a phone to answer.]

A brown book lies on the sales counter.

>take brown book
Taken.

>look at brown book
A book with a plain brown cover, titled "Astral Secrets". The author is listed as Jeremiah Horton.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

>*that's your tuning fork and lamp right there. plus the lenses I'm wearing
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>look at diagram
The paper is covered with strange sketches and diagrams. In one corner is scrawled the cryptic phrase "Save the Dragon".

>e
Faraji heads back out into the street.

Clouds have gathered over the town.

South of here, Henry's Hot Skillet promises all of the comforts of the mid-twentieth-century diner. A bookstore named The Reading Room lies to the west, while Fresnel's Music is southwest.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the north, walking on the road leading out of town.

To the north, the shadowy figures move south, walking on the 100 block of Solvay Road.

Agent Faraji is in Henry's Hot Skillet. This is the epitome of the homey small-town diner of times gone by, except for the lack of all furniture, cooking implements, food, decor, and so on. There is a staircase leading up, and the exit is north. A pair of insulated wires hangs from the ceiling at one end of the counter.

[It's a diner without any food or furniture. So, just a room, really.]

>look at wires
Two insulated wires with bare ends, they probably once attached to some electrical device sitting on the counter.

>up
Faraji heads up the stairs to the roof.

The drizzle picks up a bit, and the air grows colder.

Agent Faraji is on Henry's Roof. From here one can see much of the town, including a clear view of the obelisk in Enigma Park. There is a large TV aerial jutting from the roof here.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the north, walking on the 100 block of Solvay Road.

To the north, the shadowy figures move south, on the corner of Main and Solvay.

>look at aerial
A large, metallic rooftop antenna, characterized by its array of horizontal and vertical rods designed to capture VHF (very high frequency) broadcasts. Strangely, someone has mounted a threaded socket, like that of a light bulb, on one of the rods. A pair of insulated wires runs from the antenna and through a hole in the roof.

To the north, the shadowy figures move north, walking on the 100 block of Solvay Road.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "No one will be allowed to interfere with our plans. Begone!"

>e
The lizard people block the way.

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by stone walls.

>i
Faraji is carrying:
  Astral Secrets
  a tuning fork
  a brass key
  a pair of bolt cutters

  Tribes of New York

  a strange piece of paper
  a pair of astral lenses
