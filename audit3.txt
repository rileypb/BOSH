>x skull
It looks a bit Neanderthal, actually.

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask to borrow the skull.

>ask to borrow skull
They ask, "Chief, mind if I borrow the skull?"

He looks pained for a moment. "Uh, I'd rather you didn't. It's fragile."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>x lenses
To all appearances an ordinary pair of glasses, the astral lenses allegedly reveal the existence of extra-dimensional pathways.

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask to borrow the astral lenses.

>ask to borrow lenses
They ask, "Would it be okay if I borrowed the astral lenses for a while?"

"Sure! Why don't you scout the locality for astral phenomena?"

They take the astral lenses.

Faraji tries to put on the astral lenses, but the fluorescent light is blinding. They take them off again.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>x bookcase
The Chief's library boasts many interesting titles, from Alton Cherry's Waiting for the Aliens to Debi Bosworth's My Travels in Time. For the uninitiated, there is also a copy of The Dictionary of Strangeness. One might also be interested in A Short History of BOSH.

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>read waiting
Alton Cherry's Waiting for the Aliens is a classic of the genre. More a history of publicly-known material than an argument for or against the existence of aliens on earth, it is accessible to believers and non-believers alike.

Klimp flips his pen between his fingers and says, "Never believe a Freemason when he tells you he's just a guy who likes to wear aprons. They're up to something. I know it. Sometimes. Sometimes I believe the exact opposite."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>read bosworth
Debi Bosworth's My Travels in Time is the account of Ms. Bosworth's alleged travels to the past and future. She is careful to point out that she has never known a man in a blue box.

The Dictionary of Strangeness is a compendium of the weird and wonderful, from the Abominable Snowman to Zener Cards. Flipping through it, Faraji comes upon an entry:

Divining

Divining is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic, standardized process or ritual. Used in various forms throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a querent should proceed by reading signs, events, or omens, or through alleged contact with a supernatural agency. Dowsing is a type of divining, by which a person uses a rod, stick, or pendulum to locate such things as underground water, hidden metal, buried treasure, oil, lost persons or golf balls, etc.

Chief Klimp says "If you want to know more about anything in there, just ask me."

Klimp looks around and says, "I don't like this new office. I liked the old one. It had character. It had history. It had a ghost. I miss that ghost."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask klimp about divining
"Chief, have you ever used a di--"

"--vining rod? Yes, I have. I've used it to find water, to find gold, to find the Black Knight Satellite. I once used it to find a lost cat. It didn't work."

"Real? Yes, it's real. I mean, it's not a satellite, but it's real. You ever hear of the Tunguska Event? There's a connection, you know."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask about event
"Chief, what's the deal with the Tunguska --"

"Event? I have a theory. Most people think Lenin was born on Earth in 1870, but I have evidence that he was born on the Black Knight Satellite and came to Earth in a meteorite that landed in Tunguska in 1908."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>look up event in dictionary
Tunguska Event

The Tunguska event was a large explosion that occurred near the Stony Tunguska River in Yeniseysk Governorate, Russia, on the morning of June 30, 1908. The explosion over the sparsely populated Eastern Siberian Taiga flattened 2,000 square kilometers of forest, and is estimated to have had the force of 10-15 megatons of TNT, which is about 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>x short h
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine Short History of BOSH.

>x short 
A Short History of BOSH is a slim volume detailing the Bureau's founding and history from its inception in 1947 to the present day. Chief Klimp has also added his own notes at the end, among which is the following passage:

"Two years into my tenure saw the election of the stupidest man in government: Senator S. Savra. It's bad enough that no one knows what his first initial stands for, but he's also undeniably a tool of the aliens. He may even be an alien himself. In any case, he's made it his mission to defund the Bureau, and he's been very successful at it. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep the lights on. I'd lay odds that he's been to the Black Knight Satellite."

"Screwdriver you could borrow? No, no, someone stole my screwdriver collection. Probably the Illuminati."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

>ask about illuminati
Faraji begins, "You believe in the --"

"Illuminati? Of course. They're everywhere. They're in the government, in the media, in the music industry. They're in the Bureau. They're in the BOSH offices. They're in the White House. They're in the Vatican. They're in the Black Knight Satellite." Klimp looks around. "They're in this room... okay, maybe not this room. And hopefully not in the BOSH offices. But they're everywhere else. You don't think Margaret's Illuminati, do you?"

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

>ask about beatles
"Chief, you like the --"

"Beatles? Of course I do. I'm the one who found Paul McCartney's shoes after the Abbey Road photo shoot. Now, Paul's quite a character. Likes to hang out in the sewers of Istanbul. I don't know why."

"Chief, what do you know about --"

"Siberia? Not much. But enough to know that when the lizard people take over, that's where I'm going to hide. Those cold-blooded bastards will never find me there."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

>ask about lizard
"Chief, what do you think about --"

"-- lizard people? Don't believe the hype. They're not all bad. Some of them are just misunderstood. Doris gets all excited about them. But lizards are cute, don't you think?"

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

>ask about doris
"Chief, who is D--

"Doris? He's a friend of mine. Works for the Bureau. Sort of. Snappy dresser. Prone to outlandish stories. Ask him about the Mothman."

"Geez, West Virginia has the lamest cryptids. The Mothman is just a big owl. A big owl from another world."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Klimp taps his fingers on the desk and says, "Did I ever tell you about my friend Doris? We went a lot of places together back when the Bureau was just starting out. He's a good guy. A bit of a liar, but a good guy."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

>ask about earth
"Chief, what are your thoughts on --"

"-- the Earth? It's hollow, and John Lennon is living inside it. He's waiting for the alien invasion. He's going to defeat them with his telekinetic powers. He wrote all about it in his song 'Last Train to Clarksville.'"

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

>ask lenin
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>a lenin
"Chief, what do you think of --"

"Lennon? Imagine he's still alive. I've seen the evidence. Mark David Chapman didn't kill him. He's living in a hidden city on the inside of the earth. But I don't think that's what you meant. You meant Lenin, didn't you? I can't remember what I think about him."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

>a chapman
Which do you mean, Mark David Chapman or Tracy Chapman?

>mark david
"Chief, what do you know about Mark David --"

"Chapman? What a stooge! What a maroon! He was set up by the Illuminati to take the fall for John Lennon's assassination. He was actually in Budapest at the time. No relation to Tracy Chapman."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

"Chief, what do you know about --"

The Kelly-Hopkinsville Encounter

The Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter, also known as the Hopkinsville Goblins case, occurred on the night of August 21, 1955, in rural Kentucky, USA. The Sutton family and their guests claimed to have encountered strange, small, metallic-looking creatures with large eyes and pointy ears, which they believed to be extraterrestrial beings. Throughout the night, the family reported being besieged by these entities, leading to a frantic shootout. Although there was no concrete evidence of the creatures" existence, the Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter remains one of the most famous and perplexing cases in UFO and paranormal lore, captivating the public's imagination and sparking ongoing debate among skeptics and believers alike.

The Illuminati

The Illuminati is a group descended from the Bavarian Illuminati that exerts influence over world events. The group conspires to establish a New World Order, and is said to be involved in various global events, such as the French Revolution, the American Revolution, and the September 11 attacks.

Huffton Klimp, or simply "The Chief", who by his name and title should rightly be big and gruff, is a wiry guy with a thinning shock of red hair on top. Once the youngest and most devoted recruit in the Bureau, the years and his promotion to Bureau Head have not dulled his enthusiasm and idealism. He's a true believer in the existence of aliens, and he's convinced that the Bureau is the only thing standing between humanity and the alien menace. He's also convinced that the Bureau is the only thing standing between him and a comfortable retirement. He's a good guy, but he's a bit of a pain.

Faraji pushes through the back door into the cool night.

Clouds have gathered over the town.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. It's probably beautiful during the day, but tonight the deep shadows among the trees seem ominous. Faraji is watchful and tense as they explore the park.

The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by iron fences.

A light drizzle begins to fall, chilly in the night air.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "Silly human. You will fail!"

>ask about object
"What is that shiny object?" asks Faraji.

"It is ours," hisses the lizard person. "You will not have it."

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

A look at the various Native American tribes of New York state, from the pre-Columbian era to the present day. The chapter on the Onondaga tribe reads:

The Onondaga tribe is one of the original five tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy. They are known for their longhouses, which can be up to 200 feet long, and for their traditional government, which is based on a system of clans. The Onondaga are also known for their traditional arts and crafts, such as beadwork, pottery, and basketry. There is no truth to the rumors that the ancient Onondaga consorted with lizard people.

Faraji head north along Lake Street, toward the lake.

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road. The intersection lies at the edge of the lake. Lake Street runs south into town, while Ridge Road heads off into the darkness east of here. A little path along the lake shore is to the west.

There is an abandoned pickup truck at the side of the road.

>x truck
(the abandoned pickup truck)
The truck, a Ford F-1, is relatively new, with no sign as to why it was abandoned. The hood is slightly crumpled, as if it has been in a minor accident. The truck bed contains a pair of bolt cutters.

The storm rages, the air filled with the sound of thunder and the smell of ozone.

Taken.

To the south, some shadowy figures emerge from the park at Lake Street by the park, moving east.

The battery is dirty and corroded. Acid has leaked from the terminals. It's unlikely to be of any use.

With so much acid on the battery, it's probably best not to touch it with bare hands. To be honest, the battery looks like it's a lost cause anyway.

Faraji is carrying:
  a brass key
  a pair of bolt cutters
  a tuning fork
  an extension cord
  a telescope
  a red key
  a backpack (empty and open)

Faraji follows the lake shore west.

Agent Faraji is on the lake shore north of the park. The storm rages over the lake, lightning flashing and thunder rolling. The park is to the south, while the lake stretches off to the north, and the shore goes west. A workshed is to the southeast. A road can be seen to the east.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "Silly human. You will fail!"

>z
Faraji stands around and waits.

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Faraji slips into the shadows of the park.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by iron fences.

Faraji enters the dirty shack.

Agent Faraji is in a dirty shack. Someone lives here, though not at all luxuriously. Plates are stacked up by the sink, and there's a pile of used paper coffee cups in the corner. The whole place stinks of cat.

An orange cat stretches out on the bed.

A bony old man lies on a bed in a corner of the shack. He stirs sleepily and says "Ah, there you are, there you are. Knew you'd be around eventually."

Also here is a sledgehammer.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask who he is.

Faraji can ask who he is.

>ask who
They ask, "You seem to know me, but who are you?"

"Name's Hutz. I'm the town groundskeeper. Or was, I guess. Not much to keep now."

Faraji can ask why he's still here.

>a still
They ask, "Why are you still here? The town is being flooded tomorrow."

"Had a feeling someone might come by looking for help. And here you are." Hutz grins, showing a few teeth. "I'm not going anywhere, not yet. Not until I've done what I need to do."

Faraji can ask how he can help them.

>ask help
"But how can you possibly help me?" they ask.

"You're looking for the secret of Enigma Lake, are you not? The secret about to be lost forever? Something calls you here; you're searching for something, no, someone. Yes, yes, Hutz can help you."

Faraji can ask about the secret of Enigma Lake or ask Hutz for help.

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding. A permanent fixture, the information desk sits near the front entrance (to the south). Taped to it is what looks to be a work schedule. There is also a back entrance onto the park to the north.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

Agent Faraji is walking on Solvay Road by the lake. Solvay Road runs by the lake shore here. It continues out of town to the northwest, while to the southeast it leads back into town. A dirty shack stands opposite the lake to the west. A path along the shore leads to the east.

>e
Agent Faraji is at west end of the town's lake shore. The lake stretches to the north, while the town lies to the south. Solvay Road can be seen to the west, and the shore continues to the east.

>e
Faraji heads east along the lake shore.

Agent Faraji is on the lake shore north of the park. The storm rages over the lake, lightning flashing and thunder rolling. The park is to the south, while the lake stretches off to the north, and the shore goes west. A workshed is to the southeast. A road can be seen to the east.

>se
Agent Faraji is in the workshed. It is a small, weathered building, with a single door and no windows, and a creaky wooden floor. The interior is almost dark. An empty light socket hangs from the ceiling. A closed cabinet is in the corner. An open rusty metal door leads out of the shed.

>open cabinet

Faraji opens the equipment cabinet, revealing a strange, rusty, metal object.

Faraji heads south into the heart of town.

Agent Faraji is on the corner of Main and Solvay. Main Street runs east from here, while Solvay Road heads north. South of here, Henry's Hot Skillet promises all of the comforts of the mid-twentieth-century diner. A bookstore named The Reading Room lies to the west, while Fresnel's Music is southwest.

>w
Faraji, hankering for a good book, heads into the bookstore.

Agent Faraji is in the Reading Room. The reading room is a small, cozy space, with a number of comfortable chairs and a few tables. A sales counter is at the back of the room. Bookshelves lead back into the depths of the store. A narrow staircase leads down and the front door is east.

A brown book titled Astral Secrets lies on the sales counter.

A book with a plain brown cover, titled "Astral Secrets". The author is listed as Jeremiah Horton.

Flipping through the book, Faraji finds a dog-eared page. The page shows a diagram of a small, metallic, cylindrical object, which is labeled "astral resonator". The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

Agent Faraji is in the Bookstore Basement. The basement is dark and musty, with a number of shelves and boxes of books. The walls are made of old, crumbling brick. There is a faint breeze. A narrow staircase leads up.

A book with a green cover titled The Ecology of Root Vegetables lies on the floor here.

Faraji climbs through the hole in the wall, into the stench of the sewer.

Agent Faraji is in a sewer tunnel. The tunnel is dark and damp, with a low ceiling. From here, it leads east. To the west it narrows to little more than a pipe. To the south is a hole leading into a basement.

(Tribes of New York)
A look at the various Native American tribes of New York state, from the pre-Columbian era to the present day. The chapter on the Onondaga tribe reads:

The Onondaga tribe is one of the original five tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy. They are known for their longhouses, which can be up to 200 feet long, and for their traditional government, which is based on a system of clans. The Onondaga are also known for their traditional arts and crafts, such as beadwork, pottery, and basketry. There is no truth to the rumors that the ancient Onondaga consorted with lizard people.

The drizzle falls steadily, chilling the air.

Agent Faraji is walking on Lake Street by the gym. Lake Street runs north and south from here. To the east is the public gymnasium, while to the west is the town hall, which is not enterable from here.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "You are too late to stop us. We will have the Dragon!"

>ask about lizard
"Who are you?" asks Faraji."

The lizard people hiss as if in laughter. "We are the first ones and the last ones. You will all learn our names."

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is on the radio station roof. They can see the obelisk in the park clearly from here. The broadcast tower rises many feet above them. The exit is down. A metal cabinet is attached to the foot of the tower, held shut by a padlock.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the northwest, walking on Lake Street by the gym.

The drizzle stops, at least for now.

>d
Agent Faraji is in Radio Station WGXC. This is the town radio station. An eye-catching sign over the door reads "WGXC 'Galaxy' Radio 1055 AM".

A staircase runs upwards, presumably to the roof and the broadcast antenna. The broadcast booth is to the south. The exit is northwest.

Faraji treads the eerily quiet street westward, encountering a clump of shops.

Agent Faraji is on the corner of Main and Solvay. Main Street runs east from here, while Solvay Road heads north. South of here, Henry's Hot Skillet promises all of the comforts of the mid-twentieth-century diner. A bookstore named The Reading Room lies to the west, while Fresnel's Music is southwest.

To the east, some shadowy figures emerge from the department store at the 200 block of Main Street, moving north.

Agent Faraji is in Henry's Hot Skillet. This is the epitome of the homey small-town diner of times gone by, except for the lack of all furniture, cooking implements, food, decor, and so on. There is a staircase leading up, and the exit is north. A pair of insulated wires hangs from the ceiling at one end of the counter.

>x counter
A typical mid-twentieth-century lunch counter.

Agent Faraji is on Henry's Roof. From here one can see much of the town, including a clear view of the obelisk in Enigma Park. There is a large TV aerial jutting from the roof here.

>x aerial
A large, metallic rooftop antenna, characterized by its array of horizontal and vertical rods designed to capture VHF (very high frequency) broadcasts. Strangely, someone has mounted a threaded socket, such as might hold a light bulb, on one of the rods. A pair of insulated wires runs from the antenna and through a hole in the roof.

>x wires
A pair of insulated wires, running from the antenna and through a hole in the roof.

>x hole
A hole in the roof, through which a pair of insulated wires run. It's not big enough to do anything with.

Putting things on the threaded socket would achieve nothing.

To the north, some shadowy figures come into view from the northwest, walking on the road leading out of town.

The world turns inside out, and suddenly Faraji is somewhere else.

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris. The exit is east.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask about Savra, or ask about time travel.

>e
Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north to Minerva's office, south to Christy's office, east to the front office, west to Doris's office, forth to the portal to the past, and back to the auxiliary portal.

>b
Agent Faraji is in Portal Room 2. The room is full of humming, glowing machinery, all of it attached to a large, arch-shaped portal in the middle of the room. A sign on the portal says "Auxiliary Portal". The exit is forth.

The portal is made of the same astral stuff this whole dimension is made of. Inside it is a shimmering curtain of light, leading to another time and place. It is labeled "Auxiliary Portal".

>enter
Faraji enters the field of light, and they are suddenly somewhere else.

Agent Faraji is in the utility closet. It is cramped in here. Other than Faraji, the only thing in here is a breaker box on the wall. A open door leads west.

>w
Agent Faraji is in Moira's office. It is, like Moira herself, neat and orderly. She's clearly made the most of the meager funds she had for furnishing her office. Behind a modest yet functional desk is a modest yet functional office chair. Her bookshelves are filled with titles relating to investigative techniques, law, and skepticism. In the east wall is a closet door. The exit is to the south.

Moira Zin is here, arranging her new office.

Moira looks pensive. "I'm not sure whether Margaret is a help or a hindrance."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the south.

Faraji can tell Moira Zin about the hyperdimensional portal or ask for a screwdriver.

>s
Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. All of the doors are open.

A phone is ringing to the south, in Faraji's office.

>e
Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter functions as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coat rack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm.

Also here is Faraji's computer.

Margaret pauses to look at the photos on the wall. "Everyone looks so happy. I wonder what they're doing now. Well, except you, Moira, and the Chief. I know what you're doing now."

A phone is ringing somewhere to the west.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask about the phone exchange, ask where Klimp is, or ask where Moira is.

>e
Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash (to the east). To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Klimp's Porsche takes up two spots.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby.

>open car hood
Which do you mean, Chief Klimp's Porsche, Faraji's Hyundai, or the automatic car wash?

Faraji opens the Hyundai hood, revealing a clean car battery.

An old bright red Hyundai Accent, it's been their personal means of transportation for years. And since the Bureau lost its fleet, it's their work car too. Two years ago, they had to replace the hood after a window A/C unit fell on it. Now it doesn't exactly match the rest of the car.

Agent Faraji is on the second floor of the Horton Family House. The second floor is a small, cramped space, with a single window looking out over the front yard. A small bed sits in one corner, while a closed wardrobe stands against a wall. A staircase leads down.

>lie in bed

>lie on bed
Faraji gets onto the small bed.

Faraji gets off the small bed.

>* lie in should work
Noted.

>open wardrobe
Faraji opens the rickety wardrobe, revealing The Witnessing of Hezekiah.

>read witnessing
A small, leather-bound book, titled "The Witnessing of Hezekiah: as told to Jeremiah Horton by Hezekiah Horton". The book is filled with strange, cryptic passages, and is difficult to read. Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Put into it the resonant instrument, the ghostly source of light, and the astral focus. Strike the frame with my Rod to create the astral resonator. Ascend the ladder and channel a mighty power through the resonator, directing it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, illuminate the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

>d
Faraji heads back down the shaky stairs.

Agent Faraji is in the Horton Family House kitchen. The house is a modest colonial-period building. Strangely, the furnishings of the house have been left in place, despite the coming flood. An open hearth is in the center of the room, with a few chairs and a table. The parlor is to the south, and a narrow staircase leads up. To the east the front door leads out to Solvay Road, while another exit leads west to the family graveyard.

>e
Faraji steps out of the Horton House onto Solvay Road.

The storm rages, the air filled with the sound of thunder and the smell of ozone.

Agent Faraji is walking on Solvay Road leading out of town. Solvay Road bends here, leading northwest out of town and south back into town. East is the park, and to the west is Horton House. One can walk down to the lake shore to the north.

A bright beam of light shoots from Henry's Hot Skillet, striking the obelisk in the park. The crystal is glowing faintly.

>e
Faraji enters the park.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by iron fences.

Agent Faraji is walking on Lake Street by the park. Lake Street runs north and south from here. To the west is the park, while to the east is the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake.

The socket end of an extension cord lies on the ground, the table lamp plugged into it. The other end trails east into the church.

Agent Faraji is in the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake. The interior is dimly lit by the stained glass windows, and the pews are arranged in neat rows facing the pulpit. A standard electrical outlet is set into the wall. To the east is the vestry. Faraji can also take a ladder up to the steeple, or stairs down to the basement. The exit is to the west.

The doll-fly buzzes menacingly around the sanctuary, its eyes glowing with an eerie light.

The plug end of an extension cord is plugged into the electrical outlet. The other end is in Faraji's hand.

>hit fly
The doll-fly shrieks "Begone! Or I, Bazell the Self-serving, shall smite thee!"

Bazell the Self-serving moves up out of Faraji's reach.

The obelisk itself has begun to glow. The light from the crystal at its apex grows brighter and brighter, until it's almost blinding. Shielding their eyes, Faraji watches as the space around the obelisk shimmers and distorts. The previously gentle breeze is now a gale, howling through the struts of the radio tower. Then, with a huge crack, a bolt of lightning strikes the crystal. One can almost sense the electricity penetrating the earth. searching for something. And then, it's found it. Below the obelisk, something has woken.

A shimmering portal hovers in the center of the chamber, casting a faint light over the room.

Faraji steps through the portal. The circular chamber vanishes, and...

The chamber is dark and damp, smelling of earth and old vegetable matter. The walls, floor, and ceiling are packed earth. Around the walls are some woven baskets for storing vegetables: a red one and a blue one nearby, and a green one near Daniels. Light filters in from a passage to the north.

Faraji finds themself in the midst of a hostile confrontation. On one side are the same group of lizard people they banished from Enigma Park; on the other, a lone bedraggled man, clutching a root vegetable and wearing a very nice watch. Despite their superior numbers, the lizard people seem to be wary of their opponent. Presumably, the bedraggled man is the Daniels that Faraji was sent to find.

The lizard people turn to Faraji. "You!" one of them hisses. "You thought you could banish us, but we have returned to snatch your victory from the jaws of our defeat... or something or other. And now we are on the threshold of our greatest triumph! Soon the Dragon will be ours!"

Presumably-Daniels speaks up.  "Seriously guys, you're always so over-dramatic. Besides, I've got you right where I want you. Just watch." He shakes his potato at the lizard people. As he does, you notice his right arm looks injured.
