>ask to borrow lenses
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

Agent Faraji is in the BOSH chief's office. Chief Klimp's office is full of character. Shelves strewn with knick-knacks abut a cozy armchair and a mahogany side table supporting a large globe. A bookcase on the north wall is packed with books on paranormal happenings. Garish prints adorn the remaining wall space.  Under one of these is a modernistic desk of glass and chrome, behind which is a very nice black leather swivel chair. There is a computer on the desk, and to its side is an antique wooden file cabinet. To tell the truth, it's all a bit much, but it matches Klimp's personality perfectly. There is an exit to the east.

Chief Klimp sits behind the desk, his feet up.

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>borrow lenses
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>x shelves
(the Chief's shelves)
These shelves sport an array of oddities and memorabilia.

On the Chief's shelves are a juvenile sasquatch skull and a pair of astral lenses.

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>x lenses
To all appearances an ordinary pair of glasses, the astral lenses allegedly reveal the existence of extra-dimensional pathways.

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask to borrow the astral lenses.

>ask to borrow lenses
They ask, "Would it be okay if I borrowed the astral lenses for a while?"

"Sure! Why don't you scout the locality for astral phenomena?"

They take the astral lenses.

A phone is ringing somewhere to the east.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>e
Faraji breathes easier as they leave the office of the Chief of BOSH.

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. Moira's door is closed; Faraji's door and Klimp's door are open.

A phone is ringing to the south, in Faraji's office.

>s
Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair. In lieu of windows, there are a few things on the wall: their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake, and a photo of their soccer team. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

A phone is ringing inside Faraji's desk.

A phone is ringing inside Faraji's desk.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask about the locked desk, ask where Klimp is, or ask where Moira is.

>w
(first opening the BOSH back door)
The scent of asphalt and old cigarette butts greets Faraji as they leave the office.

Agent Faraji is in the back lot. This is a small area of asphalt between the building and a chain link fence looking in on an industrial property. A door to east leads into the BOSH offices, and one to the north enters the laundromat. There is a blue dumpster here.

Margaret arrives from the east, carrying a couple of flattened boxes.

Agent Faraji is in the back lot. This is a small area of asphalt between the building and a chain link fence looking in on an industrial property. A door to east leads into the BOSH offices, and one to the north enters the laundromat. There is a blue dumpster here.

A strange sparkly white passage branches off in an impossible direction from here.

Faraji has discovered a stark white hyperspatial tunnel! It leads in the hyperspatial direction of "back".
For help regarding hyperspace, enter HELP HYPERSPACE.

Margaret is here, carrying a couple of flattened boxes.

Margaret tosses the flattened boxes over the edge of the dumpster.

A phone is ringing to the east, in Faraji's office.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask about the locked desk, ask where Klimp is, or ask where Moira is.

>help hyperspace
Hyperspace is a four-dimensional plane of being overlaying our own three-dimensional plane. The familiar directions (north, south, up, northeast, etc.) work there, as do two new directions "back" and "forth", and their combinations with our compass directions: forthnorth, backeast, etc. These can be abbreviated just as compass directions can: b, f, fn, be, and so on.

>b
Faraji steps carefully into the astral tunnel.

Agent Faraji is in the astral tunnel. It is featureless white, or what passes for white here. It leads "forth" at one end and north at the other.

>n
Faraji continues with trepidation along the astral tunnel.

Agent Faraji is in the astral tunnel. It is featureless white, or what passes for white here. It leads south at one end and "forth" at the other.

>d
Faraji can't just dig downward.

>f
Faraji stares with amazement as they emerge into the laundromat.

Agent Faraji is in the laundromat back room. A desk sits in the corner covered with papers. An opening leads east to the laundromat proper, while a steep set of stairs leads down. The back door is to the south.

A stark white hyperspatial tunnel leads in the direction of "back".

Wearing the astral lenses in fluorescent light is blinding. They quickly remove the glasses.

>d
Faraji carefully navigates the narrow stairs to the basement.

Agent Faraji is in the laundromat basement. A few boxes of supplies sit here and there in the otherwise empty space. Stairs lead up, while a doorway leads south.

>s
Faraji forges onward, deeper into the bowels of the laundromat.

Agent Faraji is in the back basement. The basement ends here. There is a switch on the wall, currently on. A doorway leads north.

A strange blue-white glow emanates from behind some stacks of large crates.

>turn off lights
Faraji switches the light switch off.

It is now pitch dark in here!

They can still see a little bit, though, thanks to the glow-in-the-dark light switch on the wall. There is also a strange blue-white glow emanating from behind some large dark objects.

>wear lenses
Faraji puts on the pair of astral lenses.

Agent Faraji is in the back basement. The basement ends here. There is a switch on the wall, currently off. A doorway leads north.

>f
Faraji steps into the astral tunnel.

Agent Faraji is in the astral tunnel. It is featureless white, or what passes for white here. It leads "back" at one end and "forthnorth" at the other.

>fn
Faraji exits the astral tunnel into the front room of the laundromat.

Agent Faraji is in the laundromat. The deserted laundromat is lit dimly by the light filtering in from outside. The machines are old and worn, but still seemingly functional. An opening leads west to the back room, and the exit is to the southeast.

A stark white hyperspatial tunnel leads in the direction of "backsouth".

Also here is a handtruck.

>push truck bs
Faraji steps carefully into the astral tunnel.

Faraji pushes the handtruck along with them.

Also here is a handtruck.

>move crates with truck
Faraji moves the crates out of the way and uncovers an old front-loading washing machine. There is a strange blue-white glow inside the drum. The door is closed.

>open drum
Faraji opens the broken washing machine.

>enter it
There is a flash of light and Faraji finds themself somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is on a featureless hyperplane. They rub their eyes as they try to take in their surroundings. In addition to the usual directions of north and south and east and west, two new directions exist here: back and forth. As a result, the "surface" they're standing on is in fact a three-dimensional hyperplane. Up and down still exist, and there is gravity, apparently.

As far as one can see, the hyperplane extends infinitely in all six directions.

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forthnorth.

Wearing the astral lenses is overwhelming here, so Faraji takes them off.

>fn
Faraji trudges across the trackless hyperplane, and ends up somewhere else, yet exactly the same.

Faraji treks across the blank landscape, seemingly going nowhere.

There is an Ethereal Pillar here. A message carved into the pillar says "All you need is love : love : love -Doris"

Under that is a line of five ethereal symbols: o p q d b

A mystic compass dangles from an outcropping of the pillar.

Agent Faraji is at the top of a descending stair. It is made of the same stark white, questionably real stuff as the ground, the pillar, and the mystic compass. Faraji can't see past the first turn of the stairs, unfortunately.

Faraji descends the stairs and discovers... an office?

Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

A young woman is sitting at the desk. Apparently doing nothing, she looks up from her desk and smiles at Faraji. "Hello, I'm Maggie," she says. "Welcome to the BOSH Hyperspace Field Office, Agent Faraji. Did you have a nice time getting here? I hope so. I helped design the lobby." She resumes staring at the opposite wall.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver or ask how to get home.

Faraji asks, "How can I get home from here?"

Maggie snaps out of her reverie. "Oh, you're ready to go? I'll activate the auxiliary portal for you" She types rapidly on her control panel, then says "It's all ready -- go west down the hallway and turn to the back into Portal Room 2."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>w
Faraji leaves Maggie's relentless stare behind.

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north to Minerva's office, south to Christy's office, east to the front office, west to Doris's office, forth to the portal to the past, and back to the auxiliary portal.

Faraji takes a strange turn into a room labeled "Portal Room 2".

Agent Faraji is in Portal Room 2. The room is full of humming, glowing machinery, all of it attached to a large, arch-shaped portal in the middle of the room. A sign on the portal says "Auxiliary Portal". The exit is forth.

The portal is made of the same astral stuff this whole dimension is made of. Inside it is a shimmering curtain of light, leading to another time and place. It is labeled "Auxiliary Portal".

Agent Faraji is in the field office hallway. The hallway is white and gleaming. Doorways lead north to Minerva's office, south to Christy's office, east to the front office, west to Doris's office, forth to the portal to the past, and back to the auxiliary portal.

>w
Faraji enters the domain of the chief of the field office.

Agent Faraji is in the field office chief's office. Doris's office is a riot of color -- he's covered the white walls with posters, maps, and charts. A large desk is in the middle of the room, behind which sits Doris. The exit is east.

Doris is sitting cross-legged in a chair, tapping his foot lazily on the desk.

"Ah, Larch," Doris exclaims, standing up to shake their hand. "I've been waiting for you to pay us a visit. Did you bring the thumb drive?"

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home, or show him the thumb drive.

>give drive 
(to Doris)
That is not a topic of conversation at the moment.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home, or show him the thumb drive.

>show him drive
Faraji answers, "Yes, I have it."

"Fantastic! Hand it here."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home, or hand over the thumb drive.

>give drive
(to Doris)
Faraji gives the thumb drive to Doris.

"Great, great." He peruses the drive. "We lost one of our New York agents -- a guy named Daniels -- to a slingshot effect that threw him far back in time. We're always monitoring for artifacts that are out of place or anachronistic to lead us to lost agents.

He continues, "The scratch marks here say, 'They found me out and sent me back. 14th century. Old Onondaga holy place. Savra is going to move on the Dragon.'"

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home, ask about Savra, ask about the Dragon, or ask about time travel.

>ask about savra
"Senator Savra? What does he have to with anything?" Faraji asks.

Doris says, "Tell me, Agent. Do you believe in aliens? That alien species have visited Earth?"

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home, tell Doris they don't believe in alien visitation, tell Doris they do believe in alien visitation, ask about the Dragon, or ask about time travel.

>tell doris they do believe
"Yes. The evidence is overwhelming," says Faraji.

Doris laughs. "Nonsense, all of it. Get it out of your head. The whole idea is ridiculous. Senator Savra is not an alien." he looks at Faraji significiantly.

They look at him unbelievingly. "What are you talking about?"

Doris shakes his head. "I thought you would know. He's a member of a race of Earth beings more ancient than our own. Agent Faraji, Senator Savra is a lizard person."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home, ask what is a lizard person, ask about the Dragon, or ask about time travel.

>ask about person
Faraji looks incredulous. "And just what is a lizard person?"

"Just what it sounds like. It's a bipedal, intelligent reptilian creature. Strange people. Deathly allergic to rutabagas."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home, tell Doris Savra's not reptilian, ask about the Dragon, or ask about time travel.

>ask about dragon
Faraji raises an eyebrow. "Who is this 'Dragon'?"

Doris brings his finger to his lips. "Classified. Need to know only. But we should be talking about the mission instead."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home, tell Doris Savra's not reptilian, ask about the mission, or ask about time travel.

>ask about mission
Faraji says, "What's the mission?"

Doris leans back in his chair. "I believe we still have a chance to retrieve our lost agent -- the one that left the thumb drive. He says he was at an Onondaga holy place in the 14th century. Now we need to find out where that is. Fortunately, there's a book that can help. Unfortunately, I don't have it. Fortunately, you're here to go find it. Unfortunately, the name's gotten a bit jumbled in my head. I think it was something like New Bikers of Troy. Or something. I'm bad with things like titles and letters and keeping things the right way 'round. But you'll find it. I know you will. Come back here when you have."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, ask how to get home, tell Doris Savra's not reptilian, or ask about time travel.

>ask how to get home
Faraji asks, "Just how can I get home from here?"

"Go ask Maggie; she can help you."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, tell Doris Savra's not reptilian, or ask about time travel.

Faraji couldn't be happier to get away from Doris's incessant chatter.

>yell
After a few seconds, someone inserts a key in the lock and opens the door. It's Faraji's colleague Moira Zin. "How'd you get in there, Larch?"

You exit the closet.

Agent Faraji is in Moira's office. It is, like Moira herself, neat and orderly. She's clearly made the most of the meager funds she had for furnishing her office. Behind a modest yet functional desk is a modest yet functional office chair. Her bookshelves are filled with titles relating to investigative techniques, law, and skepticism. In the east wall is a closet door. The exit is to the south.

Moira Zin is here, arranging her new office.

Faraji can tell Moira Zin about the hyperdimensional portal or ask for a screwdriver.

>x books
On Moira's bookshelves are No Myth After All: A New Perspective on Atlantis, Twenty Great PhD Theses of the Twentieth Century, Anatomy of a Hoax: Writings on Modern Medicine's Greatest Myths, Tribes of New York, Applied Speculation, Biking to the Ferry: a Memoir, Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, Calculus with Infinitesimals, and The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch.

Also here is Margaret.

A phone is ringing to the south, in Faraji's office.

>e
Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter functions as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coat rack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

The Bureau's latest office manager, Margaret is bustling around with unrestrained enthusiasm.

Also here is Faraji's computer.

A phone is ringing somewhere to the west.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask about the locked desk, ask where Klimp is, or ask where Moira is.

Faraji picks up a couple of boxes and flattens them.

Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair.

The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

There is a flash of light and Faraji finds themself somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is at the top of a descending stair. It is made of the same stark white, questionably real stuff as the ground, the pillar, and the mystic compass. Faraji can't see past the first turn of the stairs, unfortunately.

On the readout of the mystic compass floats a set of ethereal symbols: o : o : o

In the middle distance is some kind of structure, roughly to the forthnorth.

Wearing the astral lenses is overwhelming here, so Faraji takes them off.

>d
Agent Faraji is at field office reception. It is a small, white (like everything else) room with a desk against one wall. An office directory is on the wall. A hallway leads west and a stairway goes up to the infinite hyperplane.

Maggie is sitting at the desk, doing nothing Faraji can discern.

Maggie looks at her hands. "Once I thought I wasn't real. But Minerva told me I was. So I guess I am."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask maggie about minerva
"Who is Minerva?"

"Minerva is our only field agent. She also has the only coffee maker in the office, which is a good thing, because I don't drink coffee. You can find her in her office, west and north."

He reads the note and grins. "I knew Christy could figure it out. Enigma Lake. Makes sense. There is a prominent intersection of leylines in the middle of the lake. Before you say it, yes it's a problem, or would be, if that intersection had always been underwater. But Enigma Lake is an artificial reservoir. The town of Enigma Lake was flooded when the reservoir was created, and that's where the intersection is!" Doris concludes with a look of satisfaction.

"So..." Faraji says.

"So. I'm sending you back to 1954, right before the flooding of Enigma Lake, and you'll find whatever Daniels left for us to find. Maybe we can stage a rescue. Why 1954? I'd rather not risk a longer temporal jaunt before we know what we're dealing with."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, tell Doris Savra's not reptilian, ask about time travel, or ask how will I find him.

>ask find
"How am I going to find him? Didn't he leave that message in the fourteenth century?"

Doris looks exasperated. "Well I don't know -- improvise, use the power of the leylines, look around for anything that looks like it might be a time portal. Something like that. Let's see if the DC office can impress me. Let me know when you're ready to go."

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver, ask who he is, ask where we are, tell Doris Savra's not reptilian, ask about time travel, or tell Doris they're ready to go.

Do not abuse this for trivial matters! Only for important things, like coffee, or fetching things from your office, or because you're bored. Now go. Out of my office and to the forth you'll find the portal room. It's all ready to send you where you need to go."

The text describes the resonator as a device for opening a portal through the astral plane. It goes on to describe the components of the device: a source of resonance, a source of light, and an "astral lens", which it declines to describe further. The text also mentions that the resonator is powered by a source of electricity.

The mystic compass pings softly.

Agent Faraji is in the Enigma Lake town hall. The building has been cleared of furniture and other items ahead of the imminent flooding.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. It's probably beautiful during the day, but tonight the deep shadows among the trees seem ominous. Faraji is watchful and tense as they explore the park.

The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by iron fences.

The lizard people seem to find your words amusing. They hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, Faraji is somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road. The intersection lies at the edge of the lake. Lake Street runs south into town, while Ridge Road heads off into the darkness east of here. A little path along the lake shore is to the west.

There is an abandoned pickup truck at the side of the road.

>x truc

>x truck
(the abandoned pickup truck)
The truck, a Ford F-1, is relatively new, with no sign as to why it was abandoned. The tailgate is down. The hood is slightly crumpled, as if it has been in a minor accident. The truck bed contains a pair of bolt cutters.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "No one will be allowed to interfere with our plans. Begone!"

Faraji is pelted by the storm.

Agent Faraji is on the radio station roof. They can see the obelisk in the park clearly from here. The broadcast tower rises many feet above them. The exit is down. A metal cabinet is attached to the foot of the tower, held shut by a padlock.

A tall, steel lattice structure, rising prominently above the building. This kind of tower was designed to maximize the height for better signal transmission and reception in the era before widespread cable and satellite technology. Strangely, the bars of the tower near roof-level are bent inward to form a small platform. It's almost as if something is meant to be mounted there.

Faraji strolls south along Lake Street to where it meets Main.

Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Main and Lake. Main goes west, while Lake runs north. The corner of the town hall is to the northwest, although it cannot be entered there. Southeast is the entrance to WGXC "Galaxy" Radio. There is a broadcast tower on top of the building.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "You are too late to stop us. We will have the Dragon!"

The drizzle stops, at least for now.

>ask about dragon
"Who is the Dragon?" asks Faraji.

"The Greatest of All, corrupted by the surface vermin," hisses the lizard person.

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is walking on Solvay Road 100 block. Solvay heads north and south. To the west is the fire station, while to the east is the side of the town hall.

Faraji heads south into the heart of town.

Agent Faraji is on the corner of Main and Solvay. Main Street runs east from here, while Solvay Road heads north. South of here, Henry's Hot Skillet promises all of the comforts of the mid-twentieth-century diner. A bookstore named The Reading Room lies to the west, while Fresnel's Music is southwest.

Wearing the astral lenses in fluorescent light is blinding. They quickly remove the glasses.

A small, leather-bound book, titled "The Witnessing of Hezekiah: as told to Jeremiah Horton by Hezekiah Horton". The book is filled with strange, cryptic passages, and is difficult to read. Faraji finds one page of particular interest. It reads, "And lo, Hezekiah, in his wisdom, did prophesy of the impending flood and the necessity to make ready. He spoke of a sacred artifact, a resonator, bestowed with divine power, that would unveil a gateway to the ethereal realm. And he revealed the quest to find the lost astral traveler who would guide the faithful out of the coming darkness. Thus spake Hezekiah: 'First form from the wood of the ash tree a frame. Put into it the resonant instrument, the ghostly source of light, and the astral focus. Strike the frame with my Rod to create the astral resonator. Ascend the ladder and channel a mighty power through the resonator, directing it towards the crystal eye. Once thou hast done this, illuminate the eye likewise twice more, and the portal shall open, revealing the path to transcendence.'"

Agent Faraji is in the Horton Family House parlor. Faraji finds something creepy about this room, as if charged with the residue of strange events long past. Which is very peculiar, considering Faraji doesn't believe in ghosts. Perhaps it's the creepy doll-fly that flew out of here.

Flipping through the book, it appears that each page consists of a name, a drawing of a strange creature, and below that a word in a strange, unknown language. The text is written in a spidery, crabbed hand, and is difficult to read.

Faraji stops on one that reads N'tsteen the Unemotional above a drawing of a dog with the thumbs of a bat, below which is written Zigig ar Zagthcr.

Agent Faraji is in the astral tunnel. It is featureless white, or what passes for white here. It bends "backnorth" to "backeast".

>bn
Agent Faraji is in the Horton Family House parlor. Faraji finds something creepy about this room, as if charged with the residue of strange events long past. Which is very peculiar, considering Faraji doesn't believe in ghosts. Perhaps it's the creepy doll-fly that flew out of here.

The parlor, like the kitchen, still has its furnishings in place. A few chairs and a table are arranged around the room.

The kitchen is to the north.

A stark white hyperspatial tunnel leads in the direction of "forthsouth".

>n
Faraji leaves the creepy parlor behind.

Agent Faraji is in the Horton Family House kitchen. The house is a modest colonial-period building. Strangely, the furnishings of the house have been left in place, despite the coming flood. An open hearth is in the center of the room, with a few chairs and a table. The parlor is to the south, and a narrow staircase leads up. To the east the front door leads out to Solvay Road, while another exit leads west to the family graveyard.

>w
The smell of fresh earth greets Faraji as they step outside.

The sky is overcast.

Agent Faraji is in the Horton graveyard. It is riddled with holes where the bodies have been exhumed for the coming flood. Likewise, the gravestones have been removed, leaving only the holes. The Horton family house is to the east.

A shovel lies on the ground, forgotten.

>take shovel
Taken.

>d
The hole is too deep to climb down into unaided.

>put ladder in hole
Faraji sets the ladder up against the side of the hole, making it easier to climb down into the large grave.

The sky is overcast, and the moon is hidden behind the clouds.

>climb ladder
Faraji climbs down the ladder into the large grave.

Something Faraji is carrying starts to vibrate.

Agent Faraji is in a large grave. The hole is substantially larger and deeper than the others.

A ladder is set up against the side of the hole, making it easier to climb out of the grave.

>dg
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

Faraji digs a little bit, and runs into something wooden. They dig a little more, and find a wooden frame. They take it with them. The vibrations cease.

A light drizzle begins to fall, chilly in the night air.

To the east the front door leads out to Solvay Road, while another exit leads west to the family graveyard.

>e
Faraji steps out of the Horton House onto Solvay Road.

The moon occasionally peeks from behind the clouds.

Agent Faraji is walking on Solvay Road leading out of town. Solvay Road bends here, leading northwest out of town and south back into town. East is the park, and to the west is Horton House. One can walk down to the lake shore to the north.

>e
Faraji enters the park.

Agent Faraji is in Enigma Park. The central focus of the park is a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the town's citizens lost in the Great War. Firs and maples line the paths. The town hall is to the south, and other exits are to the north, west, and east. Other egress is blocked by iron fences.

>e
Faraji leaves the park.

Agent Faraji is walking on Lake Street by the park. Lake Street runs north and south from here. To the west is the park, while to the east is the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake.

Three humanoid figures are here, each with a long, scaly tail and a head that looks like a lizard's. They are dressed in smart grey suits. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. One is carrying some kind of shiny metal object.

They notice you and stop talking. One of them steps forward and says in a guttural hiss, "You are too late to stop us. We will have the Dragon!"

>z
Faraji stands around and waits.

The lizard people hiss, creating a strange cloud of thick vapor. Faraji feels light-headed and disoriented. When the vapor clears, they are somewhere else...

Agent Faraji is walking on Solvay Road by the lake. Solvay Road runs by the lake shore here. It continues out of town to the northwest, while to the southeast it leads back into town. A dirty shack stands opposite the lake to the west. A path along the shore leads to the east.

>e
Faraji walks east along the lake.

Agent Faraji is at west end of the town's lake shore. The lake stretches to the north, while the town lies to the south. Solvay Road can be seen to the west, and the shore continues to the east.

A light drizzle begins to fall, chilly in the night air.

>e
Agent Faraji is on the lake shore north of the park. The continuous drizzle falls on the lake, creating ripples on the surface. The park is to the south, while the lake stretches off to the north, and the shore goes west. A workshed is to the southeast. A road can be seen to the east.

>e
Agent Faraji is at the intersection of Lake Street and Ridge Road. The intersection lies at the edge of the lake. Lake Street runs south into town, while Ridge Road heads off into the darkness east of here. A little path along the lake shore is to the west.

There is an abandoned pickup truck at the side of the road. The hood is open.

They see the faint trace of shadowy figures off to the south, walking on Lake Street by the park.

To the south, the shadowy figures move south, walking on Lake Street by the gym.

Agent Faraji is walking on Lake Street by the park. Lake Street runs north and south from here. To the west is the park, while to the east is the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake.

>e
Agent Faraji is in the First Utilitarian Church of Enigma Lake. The interior is dimly lit by the stained glass windows, and the pews are arranged in neat rows facing the pulpit. A standard electrical outlet is set into the wall. To the east is the vestry. Faraji can also take a ladder up to the steeple, or stairs down to the basement. The exit is to the west.

The doll-fly buzzes menacingly around the sanctuary, its eyes glowing with an eerie light.

>e
The doll-fly shrieks "Begone! Or I, Hobnop the Uncompromising, shall smite thee!"

Hobnop the Uncompromising prevents Faraji from reaching the east exit.

>look up hobnop in book of weird
Faraji looks up "hobnop" in the book, but finds nothing. Perhaps they are spelling it wrong.

>look up hobnop the uncompromising in book of weird
Faraji looks up Hobnop the Uncompromising in the book. Below a drawing of a doll with the head of a fly, the word flibbertigibbet is written.

>flibberti
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. I might just not recognize the words you're using.

>flibbertigibbet

>d
Agent Faraji is in the church basement. The basement is a shock to behold after the simple church above. It's a large, open space, with walls painted with scenes of humans and lizard people in battle, with aliens and platypuses looking on in horror. There is an ornate altar at the far end of the room. The exit is up.

It looks like the fluorescent tubes in the ceiling are burned out.

The extension cord Faraji is carrying trails up into the church.

>remove lenses
Faraji takes off the pair of astral lenses.

>read utilitarianism
The text is the Book of Utilitarianism. Faraji opens to a page at random and reads:

And the Lord so hated the lizard people that he smote them with a mighty smiting, and he said the cursd word "semantics", and the lizard people screamed and ran away like scared little children.

Faraji taps the wooden frame with the Rod of Hezekiah. The frame glows with a bright light. Faraji is momentarily blinded. When they can see again, the frame and its contents have fused into a makeshift astral resonator.

>x resonator
The makeshift astral resonator is a cobbled-together device, made from a tuning fork, a spotlight, and the astral lenses. A short cord with a plug dangles from the end opposite the lenses.

>u
The sky is overcast.

Agent Faraji is in the steeple. From here, they can see the obelisk in the park clearly. Someone has set up a tripod here. A telescope is mounted on it.

Faraji steps through the portal. The circular chamber vanishes, and...

The chamber is dark and damp, smelling of earth and old vegetable matter. The walls, floor, and ceiling are packed earth. Around the walls are some woven baskets for storing vegetables: a red one and a blue one nearby, and a green one near Daniels. Light filters in from a passage to the north.

Faraji finds themself in the midst of a hostile confrontation. On one side are the same group of lizard people they banished from Enigma Park; on the other, a lone bedraggled man, clutching a root vegetable and wearing a very nice watch. Despite their superior numbers, the lizard people seem to be wary of their opponent. Presumably, the bedraggled man is the Daniels that Faraji was sent to find.

The lizard people turn to Faraji. "You!" one of them hisses. "You thought you could banish us, but we have returned to snatch your victory from the jaws of our defeat... or something or other. And now we are on the threshold of our greatest triumph! Soon the Dragon will be ours!"

Presumably-Daniels speaks up.  "Seriously guys, you're always so over-dramatic. Besides, I've got you right where I want you. Just watch." He shakes his potato at the lizard people. As he does, you notice his right arm looks injured.

Faraji takes a hit! Health: 2 hearts remaining.

Daniels throws the rutabaga at Faraji. It's a weak throw, and the rutabaga merely rolls past the lizard people. It is now within Faraji's reach.

One of the lizard people looks at the nearby rutabaga and distinctly moves away from it.

>take rutabaga

>x people
There are three of them, each one seemingly a reptilian humanoid. They are dressed in grey suits with matching ties. They are obviously of intelligence comparable to humans. They are hissing loudly in what seems to be intelligent communication. They are facing you, leering menacingly.

Daniels yells rudely at the lizard people. "Hey look at me! I'm a lizard person, and I'm so stupid!"

The lizard people hiss in anger and turn to face Daniels. Daniels sticks out his tongue at them.

The short lizard person says, "Even now, Faraji, our spies are destroying BOSH from within." The stout lizard person elbows him in the ribs and hisses, "Shut up!"

>throw rutabaga at people
Faraji hurls the rutabaga at the lizard people, who in their anger at Daniels are oblivious to Faraji's action. The rutabaga strikes the leader in the head. It hisses in pain and surprise, then shrieks in terror. "No! My allergies!" The chamber fills with a white vapor. When it clears, the lizard people are nowhere to be seen.

The lizard people have been KO'd!

                         <<< FARAJI IS VICTORIOUS! >>>

Daniels approaches Faraji. "Nice throw," he says. "Glad you came when you did. As you can see, my throwing arm is worse than useless right now.

"I'm Daniels. Agent of the hyperspace field office of the Bureau of Strange Happenings and owner of the A+ Laundromat in Swamp Park, Maryland. Did Doris send you?"

Faraji can tell Daniels Doris sent me, ask about the laundromat, ask how he got here, or ask where we are.

Faraji can ask where we are or ask what's next.

>ask where we are
Faraji asks, "Where are we?"

"We're in an old Onondaga root cellar in upstate New York. Well not so old now, I guess. I've managed to make friends with the locals well enough, so they let me sleep in here."

Faraji can ask what's next.

>ask what's next
Faraji asks, "What do we do next?"

"Doris must have given you a recall button. I can rejigger it to send me to the hyperspace office and send you back to Swamp Park. Alright, give me the button."

Faraji hands the recall button to Daniels. Daniels fiddles with the device for a moment, then hands it back. "There you go. You can do the honors."

>press button
Faraji is just about to push the recall button when Daniels exclaims, "Wait! I forgot to give you this." He pushes a small metal object into Faraji's hand.

Faraji doesn't have time to look at object before their finger slips and pushes the button. The room spins and fades away, and Faraji finds themself back in Swamp Park.

The front page story is an account of the disappearance of the grandson of Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Englund Fryes. His parents, including the Senator's son, were brutally murdered in their home, but the boy, Draco Fryes, is missing and presumed kidnapped. So far there has been no ransom demand.

(first opening the pawn shop door)
Agent Faraji is in Dave's pawn shop. This is more the seedy, gloomy stereotype of a pawn shop than the glitzy, sanitized version of TV reality shows. The blinds in the windows are closed to only allow the barest slant of sunlight in, leaving the sickly fluorescent lights to illuminate the room. There is the distinct smell of cigar smoke. The glass counter is filled with a large collection of possibly valuable items. Behind it is an impressive array of firearms.

The exit is northeast.

A man, presumably Dave, stands behind the main counter eyeing Faraji.

Dave looks at the door. "I've heard of you BOSH people. You're all kind of crazy, right?"

The pawn shop door closes.

>give watch to dave
(the wristwatch to Dave)
Dave smiles when Faraji hands him the watch. "I've been looking for this," he says. "Here you go, five bucks for your trouble." He hands them a Li'l Nectarine Gift Card.

>x card
A five dollar gift card to the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store.

Dave leans on the counter. "Now, the key to breaking and entering is to not get caught."

Agent Faraji is at the south end of the strip mall parking lot. From here one can see just how humble BOSH's state has become: the office is to the west, between a pawn shop (to the southwest) and a run-down laundromat (to the northwest) and across from an automatic car wash (to the east). To the south is a swampy area separating the lot from the interstate. The parking lot continues north.

Klimp's Porsche takes up two spots.

Their bright red Hyundai Accent is parked nearby. The hood is open.

Faraji trudges to the other end of the parking lot. It's much like where they left.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center. North of here the parking lot exits onto a busy road. There is a rusty sign by the road naming the shopping center: Park Place. South is BOSH headquarters, among other things.

>n
Faraji has things to do here.

>e
Faraji is greeted by a blast of music as they enter the store.

Agent Faraji is in the Li'l Nectarine Convenience Store. Li'l Nectarine offers great service and low prices, or so they say. This one's cluttered aisles and sparse shelves could make one wonder if that's true. Behind the counter is the typical array of cigarettes and lottery tickets. Under the counter is a glass case containing various useful items.

The clerk, a scruffy man in his mid-twenties, is leaning against the counter, looking bored.

As you enter the store, you catch a glimpse of a red screwdriver in the glass case under the counter.

"Good morning," Faraji says.

"Yeah," replies the clerk.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>show card to clerk
That doesn't seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.

Faraji can ask for a screwdriver.

>ask for a screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow?"

"Got one to buy, not one to borrow."

>x it
Faraji can't see 'it' (nothing) at the moment.

>x screwdriver
A medium-length flat head screwdriver with a red plastic handle.

The clerk, looking at his phone, says, "Still got 3 hours left on my shift."

>ask about screwdriver
They ask, "Would you happen to have a screwdriver I could borrow?"

"Got one to buy, not one to borrow."

>buy screwdriver
What do you want Faraji to buy the red screwdriver with?

>buy screwdriver with card
The clerk takes the gift card and hands you the red screwdriver. "Thanks," he says.

Faraji exits the store into the relative quiet of the nearby traffic.

Agent Faraji is at the north end of the strip mall parking lot. This end is no more auspicious than the other. A convenience store lies to the east. To the west is a military recruitment center.

Agent Faraji is in the front office. It's really a small storefront done up to resemble an office. A store sales counter functions as the BOSH front desk, behind which are located shelves of office supplies and a row of drawers. There are also a couch and coffee table here creating a makeshift seating area. An old department store clothing rack serves as a coat rack. Bureau photos on the walls picture the Bureau in better days. A stack of used and empty cardboard boxes sits in one corner.

The exit is to the east, while the office continues via a hallway to the west.

Also here is their computer.

A phone is ringing somewhere to the west.

A typical air register with a grill which one would hope would stop things like, say, a hex wrench from falling through. It's set in the floor behind the front desk. The vent is held closed by four screws.

Agent Faraji is in the hallway. Their office is to the south, Klimp's is to the west, and Moira's is to the north. The front office is east. All of the doors are open.

A phone is ringing to the south, in Faraji's office.

>s
Agent Faraji is in their office. It's basically four white walls and grey carpet. There's a cheap desk and chair. In lieu of windows, there are a few things on the wall: their degree in Nonstandard Investigative Techniques, a pencil drawing of the Pitfall snake, and a photo of their soccer team. The office door is to the north, and there's a white metal door to the west.

Also here is Margaret.

A phone is ringing inside Faraji's desk.

Faraji can ask about the phone exchange, ask about the locked desk, ask where Klimp is, or ask where Moira is.

>open desk
Faraji unscrews the hex screws and removes the drawer. Inside, they find a little grey key and a blue flip phone. They put the drawer back together and pocket the key and the phone, being careful to leave the drawer unlocked.

They answer the phone.

"Hello?"

"Hello, Larch," says a familiar voice -- it's Doris.

"Doris? Why didn't you tell me you were calling when I saw you in your office?"

"Ah well, I didn't know I was going to call you then. In fact, I haven't even called you yet. It's complicated."

"What do you mean?"

"I'm calling you now, but I haven't called you yet. I'm calling you from the future."

"Oh, I see. So you're calling me from the future to tell me that you're going to call me from the future."

"No, I'm calling you from the future to get you to try to answer the phone so that you'll end up meeting me so that I'll know to call you from the future. Don't worry about it, it's all timey-wimey. Aaanyway, now that you've answered -- thanks for rescuing Daniels. Also, we need your help with something. We need you to save the Dragon." 


    *** Congratulations on answering the phone! ***


Larch Faraji will return in "BOSH II: Mazes".

[No, not that kind of maze.]
